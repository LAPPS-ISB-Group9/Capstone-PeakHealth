I’m Emma McAdam. I’m a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, and I have worked in various settings of change and growth since 2004. My experience includes juvenile corrections, adventure therapy programs, wilderness therapy programs, an eating disorder treatment center, a residential treatment center, and I currently work in an outpatient therapy clinic.  

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction.

While some viewers might find advice provided in this talk to be helpful as a complementary approach, several claims around brain size and lifestyle are not corroborated by sufficient scientific evidence. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf


Chronic stress is devastating for your brain. It ruins your memory, your attention and concentration and your emotional resilience. The brain areas that help execute these functions literally deteriorate. 

Luckily, brain science has revealed many ways to prevent or counteract this. In her talk Niki Korteweg shares the four most important things you can do to keep your brain healthy and working at its very best.

Niki Korteweg is a Dutch science journalist with a PhD in neurobiology, and she has been writing about health and brain science for almost 20 years. Ironically, after experiencing a burnout about 10 years ago, her own brain started to let her down. It was the start of a quest in the scientific literature to discover what actually helps to guard our brain against stress and make it work better than ever.  As a science journalist at NRC Handelsblad with a PhD in neurobiology, Niki is very knowledgeable about brain research, medical science, and psychology. She is a versatile journalist: she writes features, interviews, news articles, and books, gives lectures and teaches about science writing. After experiencing burnout in 2010, Niki published the book ‘Een beter brein’ (A better brain) in 2017. In this book, she discusses the fast-moving developments in neuroscience and all the ways in which we can use those insights to take good care of our brains.

You may have felt overwhelmingly stressed that you wouldn’t turn in an assignment on time, or you may have felt an abrupt feeling of anxiety wash over you as you walked over to a class podium for a presentation. Or perhaps your stress and anxiety seem constant and unrelenting. It may be difficult to do seemingly simple tasks all because you’re too overwhelmed by your anxious thoughts and stressful to-do list. Well, to help relieve some of your stress and anxiety, here are some daily habits that can reduce stress and anxiety.

WHAT IS STRESS:
Stress is something everyone feels at times, and there are all kinds of stressful situations that can be a part of daily life. Low-level stress can even be helpful or motivational.

There are plenty of things you can do to help cope with stressful events, and simple steps you can take to deal with feelings of stress or burnout.

Stress is the body's reaction to feeling threatened or under pressure. It's very common, can be motivating to help us achieve things in our daily life, and can help us meet the demands of home, work and family life.

But too much stress can affect our mood, our body and our relationships – especially when it feels out of our control. It can make us feel anxious and irritable, and affect our self-esteem.

Experiencing a lot of stress over a long period of time can also lead to a feeling of physical, mental and emotional exhaustion, often called burnout.

Stress can cause many different symptoms. It might affect how you feel physically, mentally and also how you behave.

It's not always easy to recognise when stress is the reason you're feeling or acting differently.

Physical symptoms:
• Headaches or dizziness
• Muscle tension or pain
• Stomach problems
• Chest pain or a faster heartbeat
• Sexual problems

Mental symptoms:
• Difficulty concentrating

POSSIBLE CAUSES OF STRESS:
Stress affects people differently, and the things that cause stress vary from person to person.

The level of stress you are comfortable with may be higher or lower than that of other people around you. Stressful feelings typically happen when we feel we do not have the resources to manage the challenges we face.

Pressure at work, school or home, illness, or difficult or sudden life events can all lead to stress.

Some possible causes of stress are:
• Our individual genes, upbringing and experiences
• Difficulties in our personal lives and relationships
• Big or unexpected life changes, like moving house, having a baby or starting to care for someone
• Money difficulties, like debt or struggling to afford daily essentials
• Health issues, either for you or someone close to you
• Pregnancy and children
• Problems with housing, like the conditions, maintenance or tenancy
• A difficult or troubled work environment

WHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL ADVICE:
• You're struggling to cope with stress
• Things you're trying yourself are not helping
• You would prefer to get a referral from a GP

Referring yourself for therapy
If you need more support, you can get free psychological therapies like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the NHS. You can refer yourself directly to an NHS psychological therapies service (IAPT) without a referral from a GP - https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/

Please seek emergency medical help if,
• You or someone you know needs immediate help
• You have seriously harmed yourself – for example, by taking a drug overdose
A mental health emergency should be taken as seriously as a medical emergency.

Stress is something you feel when you either have
- a lot of things going on at once
- an important decision to make
- an unexpected change in your life
- a big event coming up
- or when something really dangerous or terrifying happens to you. 
 
Stress is something that everyone experiences.  Feeling some amount of stress is normal.  When your level of stress gets to be too much, that's when it can turn into a problem.

اس ویڈیو میں ڈاکٹر ہوں اسلم بات کر رہی ہیں کہ اسٹریس کیا ہوتا ہے اور اس کو کیسے کم کیا جا سکتا ہے۔ اسٹریس انسانی دماغ میں پیدا ہونے والی خاص قسم کی تبدیلیوں کا نام ہے۔اس کی وجوہات بہت ساری ہو سکتی ہیں۔کچھ وجوہات نفسیاتی ہوتی ہیں ہیں جیسے سے لڑائی جھگڑا یا بے روزگاری یا نوکری سے نکالے جانے۔کچھ وجوہات جسمانی ہوتی ہیں جیسے اگر کوئی آدمی بیمار ہو جائے۔
اسی طرح سٹریس کا اثر بھی ذہن اور جسم دونوں پر ہوتا ہے۔بہن پر جو اثرات آتے ہیں وہ ہے اداس رہنا اتنا پریشان رہنا یا بات بات پر غصہ آنا یا منفی سوچوں کا ذہن سے نہ نکلنا۔اور اسی طرح جسم پر جو اثرات آتے ہیں اس میں شامل ہے جسمانی کمزوری سر درد بھوک کا نہ لگنا۔ نیند کا اچھا نہ آنا انا وزن کم ہو جانا۔
اسٹریس کو کم کیسے کیا جائے تو جاننے کے لیے ہماری اس ویڈیو کو پورا دیکھا جائے۔

When I did my previous video on stress, I got an overwhelming response that for most of you the workplace is your major source of stress. Now, it's normal to have stress in the workplace to a certain degree. You are going to have deadlines you have to meet at work. You are going to have expectations. But when this workplace stress becomes too great, it can actually decrease your productivity. It can decrease your success. And in addition to harming your physical health, workplace stress can roll over into your personal life, your home life, and it can affect your relationships.

So, what can you do? In my last video, I recommended that one way to reduce stress was to remove the stressor. However, for most of us, we need to work to eat, so we can't just leave our jobs most of the time. So, what can we do? If you can't leave your job, yet you can't afford to let stress harm your health, then you need to find ways to reduce this job-related stress. 
Numerous studies have shown that for the majority of American adults, they identify the workplace as the number one source of stress. How do you know if you are being affected by workplace stress? Well, you may experience anxiety and depression while at work, or even when you think about work. You may also have difficulty sleeping, insomnia. You may have a constant fear of losing your job or a fear of not meeting your job's demands. And you may even have some of the physical signs and symptoms, such as fatigue, headache, hypertension, chest pain. And you may even be more prone to infections.

This video focuses on two relaxing breathing techniques: Square breathing (aka box breathing, 4x4 breathing, 4-part breath, etc.) and Pursed breathing. More breathing exercises: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7-CAFhJn78

I start off with Square breathing. It’s so good at helping to relieve stress and anxiety that it’s sometimes used in the military to help calm nerves before stressful situations.

It’s performed just how it sounds--using your breath to make a square. Use imagery as well and imagine making a square or following something with a square pattern with your breath. Each position is 4 seconds. Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, and hold your breath again for 4 seconds. 

Pursed breathing is another breathing technique that can help relieve stress and anxiety, and it can also help make your lungs stronger. For this one, use diaphragmatic or belly breathing. Breathe in for 4 seconds, and then breathe out with pursed lips for 8 seconds.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted a research which shows that 40 percent of workers have very or extremely stressful jobs.

Joseph Lewis is a law enforcement officer for DC Metro, a community advocate for the Lutheran Immigration Refugee Service, a seminary student, and a former refugee. Born in Liberia, he lived a normal life up until 1989, when a civil war broke out in the area.

Encouragement from those in his local community inspired Joseph to go to college and earn a degree.

The world is an uncertain place. Things change fast, and it can be difficult to see what's coming next.

But with the right approach, you can make things easier for yourself, learn to be comfortable with uncertainty, and be prepared for whatever the future brings.

Here are six simple strategies for coping when things get messy.

Fear is a natural reaction to uncertainty, but you can't let it rule you.

Worrying about the future is pointless. So don't ask, ""What if?"" Ask, ""What will I do if?""

Knowing how you will react if things do go badly takes a lot of the sting out of the worry. Feeling out of control can be scary. 

So, instead of fretting about the things you can't affect, focus on the things you can. Work out what you can do, and do it.

You'll probably feel better for knowing you're doing something useful. Plan for various possibilities, not just the outcome you think is most likely.

Build in contingencies so that, whatever happens, you're in a solid position to deal with whatever comes next. Being agile means you're able to respond quickly to differing needs or adapt to changing circumstances.

Think about developing new skills, which would not only make you more valuable, but give you new career options too.

At the same time, be alert. Stay on top of changes that could affect you and your business. The sooner you know about something, the quicker you can react!

Uncertainty can cause anxiety and stress, which can damage your health and get you stuck in a vicious circle. Exercise helps clear stress hormones from your body, while meditation and mindfulness can help you relax and reduce anxiety.

Talking to someone you trust can also help you find perspective – a problem shared is a problem halved.

One of the greatest causes of unhappiness and stress in uncertain times can be comparing how we think things ""should"" be with how they are.

But ask yourself, ""According to whom?"" Often, the answer is ""nobody."" It's always good to have goals, but make them your aspirations, not your expectations.

If you can accept uncertainty for what it is, prepare yourself for various outcomes, address your worries head-on, and manage your personal stress levels, you'll cope much better in ""interesting"" times.

And, hopefully, put yourself in a position to deal with whatever comes your way.",0,00:04:01,Education,"['stress management', 'uncertainty', 'change', 'readiness', 'prepare', 'challenge']",NA,youtube,NA,Coping with work pressure_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3CU2kOBt3s,Emotional exhaustion

https://courses.therapyinanutshell.com/emotion-processing?utm_campaign=May%207,%202021&utm_medium=Description&utm_source=YouTube

Coping skills can be really important for anxiety. They often soothe or comfort us, and they help us calm down and make better choices. However, coping skills do nothing to solve our problems in the long term, and some of them, if used exclusively, can be harmful. Coping skills help us take a break from our discomfort, but also from our life purpose. So that’s why I get a little bugged when I hear that the only skill someone is learning in therapy is how to cope. 
Using coping skills to get through a crisis and get calm and then coming back and resolving the problem is the best long-term practice. This ability to pause before choosing an action is an essential skill of emotionally resilient people.

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction.

This stress affects people in different ways. Take a moment to notice and accept your feelings. These are normal reactions to an abnormal situation. It is important to take time to care for our mental health during COVID-19 and other periods of heightened stress.

Avoid coping strategies that will make you feel worse and instead use strategies like talking about your experience, spending time with loved ones, getting your news from reliable sources and taking care of yourself physically, mentally, and spiritually. 

Remember, you are not alone. If there is violence in your home or if you are thinking of hurting yourself or others, talk to a trusted friend, family member or counselor or call your local emergency hotlines. There is help in your community.

She felt free yet completely in control. When she danced, Nicole could escape the trauma of her past and the anxiety and depression that were bubbling under the surface. 

When she ruptured her hamstring, Nicole’s dreams of dancing professionally were over, and her coping strategy was gone. It wasn’t until she visited a GP that she learned how to support her mental health, and eventually dance again.

When you're anxious, does it cause you to avoid situations that make you afraid in the first place? You may be doing more hard than good. Avoidance doesn't help you learn that (a) you CAN handle fear and, (b) it doesn't work if we cannot always control our environment. AND because so much is out of our control it leads to broader fears of things getting out of control or being uncertain. The more you face your fears you'll learn that anxiety is not as big a deal because you know you have the INTERNAL resources to cope. This vlog explains this idea in a little more detail and using a simple example.

Script:

In case you hadn’t noticed, life is difficult, complex and unpredictable. You can’t change this. It’s the nature of things. But you can prepare yourself for the next unwelcome surprise. 

How? By building resilience.

Resilience is the ability to bounce back from life’s inevitable disappointments, failures, and pains.

Let me use an analogy here. 

If cars didn’t have shock absorbers, every ride would be a miserable experience. The ride through life without shock absorbers – that is, resilience – would be the same. So, without building resilience – your own internal shock absorbers – it’s not possible to lead a happy and productive life. 

Resilience is the opposite of fragility. To be fragile means that just about everything upsets you. And if just about everything upsets you, you will spend a lot of time angry and hurt. And if you spend a lot of time angry and hurt, you will not be a happy person.
 
Here, I’m not focusing on severe illness, the death of a loved one or any crushing life-changing event. In such cases, people usually need help to recover. But for most of us, such situations are rare – while the slights and disappointments of ordinary life are not. And for those, we need resilience.
 
OK, then. How do you develop resilience? Here are some suggestions to get you started, drawn from my forty-plus years as a psychiatrist. 

First, get some perspective. 

Step back and assess your situation with as much objectivity as you can. “How bad is this problem?” “Have I overstated it?” 

Sometimes my patients think an unhappy occurrence is much more serious than it really is – usually because it’s amplified by evoking a painful childhood issue. Often getting perspective is as simple as asking yourself this question: “What’s the worst thing that can happen?” Usually you’ll discover the worst thing isn’t that bad – and isn’t even likely to happen. 

Second, compare the undeserved bad things that have happened to you with the unearned good things that have happened to you. 

When I ask my patients to do this, they invariably conclude that the unearned good in their life far outweighs the undeserved bad. I’d say the ratio is at least 10 to 1. In my own case, I didn’t earn the incredibly good fortune of my grandparents moving to America, or that life-saving penicillin was available to me in my childhood when I was sick. I could go on and on. And so could you. 

In light of this, maybe things aren’t so bad after all. In fact, they’re probably pretty good. 

Third, toughen up. 

Life hits you from all directions – health, personal relationships, work challenges, family issues. To deal with them, you need to build up your mental toughness. The earlier in life one starts this process, the better. 

That’s why parents who coddle their children and protect them from every hurt and failure are not doing them any favors. Nor are colleges that provide students with so-called “safe spaces.” To toughen up, you need to push yourself. How do you know what you’re capable of if you don’t do that?

She had no idea that her personal journey was about to take her to a far darker place. In this powerful and courageous talk, she shares the three strategies that got her through an unimaginable tragedy⁠—and offers a profound insight on human suffering. Dr Lucy Hone is a director of the New Zealand Institute of Wellbeing & Resilience, a research associate at AUT University, a published academic researcher, best-selling author and contributor to Psychology Today, the Sunday Star Times and Next magazine. 

She trained at the University of Pennsylvania and got her PhD in public health at AUT University in Auckland. She has helped a range of organisations—from primary schools to leading law firms—to design and implement wellbeing initiatives creating sustained and meaningful change. 

Five years ago, the sudden death of Lucy’s 12-year-old daughter Abi forced Lucy to turn her academic training and professional practice to foster resilience in very personal circumstances. The blog she wrote in the aftermath of Abi’s death attracted international attention and resulted in the best-selling non-fiction title, What Abi Taught Us, Strategies for Resilient Grieving (Allen & Unwin, 2016), now available as Resilient Grieving in the US, UK and NZ.

Fatigue describes a state of tiredness that does not resolve with rest or sleep.[1] In general usage, fatigue is synonymous with extreme tiredness or exhaustion that normally follows prolonged physical or mental activity. When it does not resolve after rest or sleep, or occurs independently of physical or mental exertion, it may be a symptom of a medical condition that may become severe or progressive.[2]

Fatigue can be a feature of a mental disorder such as depression; may be associated with conditions of chronic pain such as fibromyalgia; it may also feature in conditions of chronic low-level inflammation, and be a disease-related symptom in many other conditions.[3] Fatigue often has no known cause, and is recognised as being very complex in nature.[4] Fatigability describes a susceptibility to fatigue.[5]

Physical fatigue results from muscle fatigue brought about by intense physical activity.[6][7][8] Mental fatigue results from prolonged periods of cognitive activity which impairs cognitive ability. Mental fatigue can manifest as sleepiness, lethargy, or directed attention fatigue.[9] Mental fatigue can also impair physical performance.[10]",0,00:03:11,People & Blogs,[],NA,youtube,NA,Overcoming mental fatigue_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyXVuO2Arc,Emotional exhaustion

As a young and successful business woman she was living a happy and fulfilled life; working long hours travelling the country, a fitness fanatic who enjoyed a full social life. Looking back there was recognition that this was unsustainable. Early recognition signs and symptoms were ignored, and led to complete burn out. Linda’s journey to full recovery sparked a passion to help others as she set up Salus Fatigue Foundation In 2001, after illness, Linda Jones, CEO Salus Fatigue Foundation & Life4Changing was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. She lost everything.   Her relentless attitude, which caused her burnout in the first place, meant she wasn’t going to just accept that diagnosis and become a statistic. Determined to recover and get her life back she took a holistic approach and coached herself back to health.  
In the last 10 years, her journey to full recovery sparked a passion to help others and this idea became the Salus Fatigue Foundation. To date 15, 000 people have been helped to create a self-managed path to recovery through raising awareness and support programs.  Linda also heads up Life4Changing helping organisations boost employee engagement, productivity and performance.

For 20 years, he has inspired countless companies including American Express, BMO, BMO Harris, Loblaw, PHH, The Co-operators, Yum! Brands Canada and some of the world’s largest Fortune 500 companies, to find the courage to:
​
consider the possibilities beyond traditional human resources strategies;
unlock the latent physical, mental, emotional and spiritual energy within their organizations;
and harness employees’ potential to get them to the point of “A.B.C.D.” (going Above and Beyond the Call of Duty).

Aside from making time for exercise, eating a proper diet, and getting enough sleep each night, there are other things we need to consider and incorporate into our life to help us recover from burnout. Some things to consider are how long of a break or vacation we need to take to give our brain time to heal? Have you ever come back from a vacation and felt totally rested? Or maybe you come back just as stressed out. Think about this for a bit, and also consider the type of break you need. Maybe you need to sit around and do nothing for 7 days, or maybe you like to get outside and hike or bike, or perhaps you prefer to see the world and experience different cultures. Take some time to consider what types of breaks you need and how often you need them.

WHAT IS BURNOUT:
Burnout is what happens when you try to avoid being a human for too long. Burnout is a state of emotional, physical and mental exhaustion cause by excessive and prolonged stress.

The term burnout was originally coined by nasa to describe a rocket which is out of fuel. Gravitational forces mean that i’s still moving but it’s essentially useless.

IS BURNOUT STRESS:
Not really, stress is a high energy state in which everything is go go go. It’s caused by a lack of control so your working harder and harder to meet demand.

Burnout on the other hand is a low energy state, you have ran out of energy to do anything, you’re going through motions and feel demotivated and you may feel your work is meaningless.

SYMPTOMS OF BURNOUT:
Burnout is characterised by 3 main features. Exhaustion and fatigue: the extreme fatigue felt by someone who has been stressed for a very long time. This can present as a complete inability to get out of bed or extreme lethargy. Your get-up-and-go has got-up-and gone! 

Perceived or actual poor performance. People suffering from burnout often feel that their performance is suffering. If the burnout isn’t recognised and treated, perception often becomes a reality.

And Depersonalisation. This characteristically presents as cynicism and lack of empathy. So lets say for example you’re a healthcare professional - This may mean that you begin treating patients as ‘objects’.

These 3 features can lead to the many symptoms and signs of burnout; which include anxiety, insomnia, headaches, other physical illnesses, feelings of lack of purpose, little interest in work and a dread of going to work, among many others.

HOW BAD IS BURNOUT FOR YOUR BODY:
In burnout, the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis which releases cortisol is put into turmoil. Cortisol is one of the stress hormones released when we perceive a threat for example  an imminent attack by a bear, or perhaps a complaint about you

Now In a normally-functioning HPA axis, once the threat has gone, the cortisol drops off and returns to normal. However, under prolonged stress, we operate under increasing levels of cortisol which never return to normal. 

The body responds by eventually down regulating cortisol production to abnormally low levels, and we may experience a state of hypocortisolism, where we have literally burned out our stress–response system. 

And As we know from our endocrine patients, hypocortisolism produces low-grade inflammation which brings many health problems, including coronary heart disease.

BURNOUT TEST:
If you find yourself exhausted, regularly dreading going to work and think that your performance is suffering so any of the symptoms we discussed then alarm bells should start to go off. Here's an online burnout test you can do: https://questionnaires.bma.org.uk/burnout-questionnaire/?OpenForm

BULDING RESILIANCE:
Reset your life and build resilience, resilience is the process of adapting well in face of adversity, it means bouncing back from difficult experiences. This is something that is unique to you and I would strongly recommend that you read the following article for more advice: https://www.independentnurse.co.uk/professional-article/cultivating-resilience-as-a-nurse/215034/

As we get older, we lose mitochondria, the energy-producing engines in the cells. And because of that,  we produce less adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the molecule that provides energy to cells throughout our bodies.

Other causes of fatigue, such as medication side effects or chronic illnesses like depression or heart disease, can make you feel tired or sluggish.

But age- and disease-related factors aren't the only things that suck your energy.

Lifestyle habits also play a part in fatigue.

In this video, I’m going to walk you through the steps to overcome adrenal fatigue.

Most fatigue problems and adrenal insufficiency come from issues with the adrenal glands. About 80% of the population deals with this common problem. There are several warning signs that indicate you may have adrenal fatigue. If you struggle with fatigue, are stressed, anxious, have trouble with concentration, poor memory, thyroid issues, or gained mysterious weight, you may have adrenal fatigue.
 
There are three steps you will want to take to get rid of adrenal fatigue for good. The first starts with your diet. Foods to get out of your diet are caffeine, sugar, and hydrogenated oils. Foods that are high in vitamin B12 and magnesium are going to support your adrenal glands and blood sugar levels so you will want to add these foods to your diet. Foods like coconut oil, coconut milk, coconut, olives, olive oil, raw dairy products, grass-fed butter, organic meats, loads of vegetables, and seaweed are all crucial to your diet as well.

Secondly, you will want to support your adrenals by taking supplements like adaptogenic herbs (such as ashwagandha, holy basil, and liquorice root), which will help your body adapt and deal with stress. Additionally, a vitamin B complex, magnesium, vitamin D, selenium will support the healing of your adrenals.

Lastly, you should focus on lowering your stress levels. Try getting 8-10 hours of sleep a night, reflect and address your stressors, add fun activities into your routine, and exercise. If you follow these three steps, you will be well on your way to naturally healing adrenal fatigue.

4:18 Treatment of Fatigue




Fatigue is a feeling of tiredness.[1] It may be sudden or gradual in onset. It is a normal phenomenon if it follows prolonged physical or mental activity, and resolves completely with rest. However, it may be a symptom of a medical condition if it is prolonged, severe, progressive, or occurs without provocation.

Physical fatigue is the transient inability of muscles to maintain optimal physical performance, and is made more severe by intense physical exercise.[2][3][4] Mental fatigue is a transient decrease in maximal cognitive performance resulting from prolonged periods of cognitive activity. Mental fatigue can manifest as somnolence, lethargy, or directed attention fatigue.[5]


Fatigue and 'feelings of fatigue' are sometimes confused.[6] Unlike weakness, fatigue can usually be alleviated by periods of rest. 
Physical fatigue, or muscle fatigue, is the temporary physical inability of muscles to perform optimally. The onset of muscle fatigue during physical activity is gradual, and depends upon an individual's level of physical fitness – other factors include sleep deprivation and overall health. Fatigue can be reversed by rest.[7] Physical fatigue can be caused by a lack of energy in the muscle, by a decrease of the efficiency of the neuromuscular junction or by a reduction of the drive originating from the central nervous system.[8] The central component of fatigue is triggered by an increase of the level of serotonin in the central nervous system.[9] During motor activity, serotonin released in synapses that contact motoneurons promotes muscle contraction.[10] During high level of motor activity, the amount of serotonin released increases and a spillover occurs. Serotonin binds to extrasynaptic receptors located on the axon initial segment of motoneurons with the result that nerve impulse initiation and thereby muscle contraction are inhibited.[11]

Muscle strength testing can be used to determine the presence of a neuromuscular disease, but cannot determine its cause. Additional testing, such as electromyography, can provide diagnostic information, but information gained from muscle strength testing alone is not enough to diagnose most neuromuscular disorders.[12]

People with multiple sclerosis experience a form of overwhelming lassitude or tiredness that can occur at any time of the day, for any duration, and that does not necessarily recur in a recognizable pattern for any given patient, referred to as ""neurological fatigue"".[13][14]",0,00:04:57,People & Blogs,"['fatigue', 'fatigue symptoms', 'fatigue meaning', 'fatigue after covid 19 recovery', 'fatigue jeff prosper', 'fatigue test', 'fatigue failure', 'fatigue meditation', 'fatigue after covid vaccine', 'fatigue pronunciation', 'fatigue fatigue', 'fatigue after workout', 'fatigue treatment']",NA,youtube,NA,Overcoming mental fatigue_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTNn6hPz9vo,Emotional exhaustion

But when it’s continuous, it actually begins to change your brain. Madhumita Murgia shows how chronic stress can affect brain size, its structure, and how it functions, right down to the level of your genes.

I explain the three major chemical systems that are altered in depression: norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. I discuss genetic predispositions to depression and how stress, thyroid hormone and cortisol play a role in many forms of depression. I also discuss inflammation as a common feature of many depression symptoms. I review 8 specific science-supported protocols for treating and avoiding depression, including EPA fatty acids (which have been shown to rival certain prescription treatments), how exercise protects against depression, studies of creatine, adjusting dopamine balance and more. I also discuss the results of ongoing clinical trials for ketamine and psilocybin for depression, how these compounds work and finally, I review how ketogenic diets can help in certain cases of depression, especially treatment-resistant major depression.

Brady Wilson is, undisputedly, the embodiment of focused energy. As co-founder of Juice Inc., Brady’s vision is to create a world where businesses pulsate with creative energy.

For 20 years, he has inspired countless companies including American Express, BMO, BMO Harris, Loblaw, PHH, The Co-operators, Yum! Brands Canada and some of the world’s largest Fortune 500 companies, to find the courage to:
​
consider the possibilities beyond traditional human resources strategies;
unlock the latent physical, mental, emotional and spiritual energy within their organizations;
and harness employees’ potential to get them to the point of “A.B.C.D.” (going Above and Beyond the Call of Duty).
​
Brady is the author of four books dedicated to improving employee performance and business results: Juice: The Power of Conversation, Love at Work, Finding the Sticking Point and his most recent book Beyond Engagement.

Rejuvenating energy levels,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdlYOcNJCEQ,Microneedling for skin rejuvenation,Dr Davin Lim,unknown,54530,332,0,26,"Micro needling for skin rejuvenation. This procedure also treats upper lip wrinkles and smoker's lines.
Upper lip lines, smoker’s creases and wrinkles, and sun damaged skin can be treated with lasers, fillers, BOTOX or a new device called INFINI microneedling radiofrequency.

Upper lip wrinkles with sun damage that involves the middle to deep layers of the skin respond best to INFINI microneedling radiofrequency. This treatment uses state of the art insulated microneedles that delivers energy in the form of radiofrequency to remodel collagen, rejuvenate the skin, diminish wrinkles, open pores and even surgical and acne scars. Unlike lasers such as Fraxel, CO2 Fractional, ProFractional, Halo, Pixel or Portrait, microneedling spares the upper layers of the skin, and delivers controlled energy into the dermal layers. What does this mean for the patient?

1. INFINI microneedling radiofrequency treatment gives a much faster healing time than even the best fractional lasers. INFINI is a form of fractional skin rejuvenation, but unlike lasers, the energy is not absorbed on the skin- its delivered deep into the skin, beneath the epidermis. Most of my patients are treated on a Friday afternoon, or Saturday morning, and they are right for work on Monday. INFINI really is a minimal downtime procedure. As a guide, if I were to perform Fraxel Fractional laser resurfacing, recovery will be at least 5 days. 

2. INFINI works much better than conventional microneedling. This is because it delivers energy (controlled heating) with insulated needles. The delivery system can target areas up to 3.5 mm deep. Additionally, I can adjust INFINI to treat different depths. For upper lip treatments, I typically deliver 2 passes at 3- 3.5 mm followed by another 2-3 passes at 2.0-2.5 mm. This means the upper lip area has approximately 5,000 micro channels (much like skin needling channels- but accurately placed in different depths, with the added benefit of radiofrequency heating). 

3. Depending on the severity of sun damage, wrinkle depth, and extent of upper lip smoker’s lines, 2-4 sessions are needed for optimal outcomes. 


For those who really want to understand this revolutionary technology, it is the way INFINI microneedles that gives this device such flexibility to tailor treatments according to skin conditions such as wrinkles, skin laxity, open pores, blackheads, scars, neck and chest rejuvenation and overall 3- dimensional facial rejuvenation. 

Skin needle insulation is part of the answer- this means the upper layers of skin are spared from energy (heat), and only the deeper layers are treated. This means very little of the energy is loss on the surface (the opposite is true for fractional lasers). Now, here is the technical side of things- a good machine can also be flexible in the energy delivery – INFINI allows me to adjust the energy levels at different depths, and also what is known as the pulse duration- meaning the length of heating. The longer the pulse duration the more collagen stimulation will be achieved- this in turn translates to shallower upper lip and smoker’s lines. 

What else do I do with INFINI? Depending on the amount of superficial sun damage on the upper lip and surrounding skin, I sometimes combine this treatment with 1927 FRAXEL. Remember, Fraxel 1927- 1550 is best for more superficial problems such as skin pigmentation, melasma, and shallow acne scars. Lately I have been combining PRP or platelet rich plasma with INFINI. The logic behind this is that skin needling – microneedling has already given me over 5,000 micro channels to deliver collagen stimulating growth factors, cytokines, and stem cells. Combining PRP and INFINI microneedling gives both better results with the added bonus of quicker recovery times. 

For patients that want that extra dermal hydration I often perform Restylane or Juvederm Volbella to treat fine lines after a course of Infini Microneedling sessions. 


I often get asked the question, will microneedling or skin rolling with ebay and amazon kits deliver the same result? The answer is no. Home skin rollers- Derma Rollers and Dermapen can improve wrinkles, scars and skin laxity, but not to the degree of insulated energy devices such as INFINI.

This is a ""real time"" Reiki session recorded from the beginning to end.  While channeling energy my focused and devoted attention will prevail throughout the session. Therefore, I do not speak and remain silent at all times. Soothing background music is used to further promote deeper relaxation during the session.

The subtle sine wave of 111Hz is playing throughout the song, 111Hz is known for having regenerative properties, as well as generating a reaction that results in a deep, divine level of meditation that brings a sense of oneness, or connectedness with the Universe or with God.

Mettaverse music is creating healing music and soundscapes for all walks of life. Sound is soul, it calls you to remember your natural state: one of peace, relaxation, better sleep, creative flow, focus, and inner peace.

Metta-verse is a vision of reality directly connected to the heart and soul of what makes us human beings, what brings us all together. ""Metta"" is a term in Pāli meaning unconditional loving kindness, a love directly from the cosmic spark deep inside your soul. Mettaverse started as a vision of one man, using music as a universal language, simply to bring people together. Resonating as one heart, as one love. Always, here and now.

May this music bring you peace, healing, and happiness. 💜

🔆 Listening to 256 Hz composed in this music gives you a feeling of stability and security. It rejuvenates your body and mind. It reduces physical and emotional pain. 

🔆(Note: To experience the best sound, Use a pair of headphones. Listen to our music in a quiet place for at least 20 / 25 minutes daily ""If Possible"". If you are a beginner then don't try to fit too much at once)

🔆 Are there any side effects of listening to our music?

This question has been asked frequently by our subscribers. There aren't any side effects of listening to our music. But we suggest the sound level coming through your headphones shouldn't be set too high, otherwise, it can cause hearing loss.

David Sinclair is a professor in the Department of Genetics and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School, where he and his colleagues study sirtuins—protein-modifying enzymes that respond to changing NAD+ levels and to caloric restriction—as well as chromatin, energy metabolism, mitochondria, learning and memory, neurodegeneration, cancer, and cellular reprogramming.  

Dr David Sinclair has suggested that aging is a disease—and that we may soon have the tools to put it into remission—and he has called for greater international attention to the social, economic and political and benefits of a world in which billions of people can live much longer and much healthier lives. 

Dr David Sinclair is the co-founder of several biotechnology companies (Life Biosciences, Sirtris, Genocea, Cohbar, MetroBiotech, ArcBio, Liberty Biosecurity) and is on the boards of several others. 
He is also co-founder and co-chief editor of the journal Aging. He is an inventor on 35 patents and has received more than 35 awards and honors. In 2014, he was on Time Magazine’s list of the “100 Most Influential People in the World,” and listed as Time's Top 50 in healthcare in 2018.

Welcome to Meditation Music by Sacred Spirit
🎼 Mindfulness music helps tune our physiology, reducing the throbbing pulse and heart rate, reducing blood pressure and stress levels. It can provide a remarkable sense of relaxation. 

🎹 ℍ𝕠𝕨 𝕥𝕠 𝕘𝕖𝕥 𝕒𝕟 𝕒𝕓𝕤𝕠𝕝𝕦𝕥𝕖 𝕖𝕩𝕡𝕖𝕣𝕚𝕖𝕟𝕔𝕖 𝕝𝕚𝕤𝕥𝕖𝕟𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕥𝕠 𝕥𝕙𝕖 𝕞𝕦𝕤𝕚𝕔. 
Relax every muscle in your body and face. Take deep breaths and try staying calm as much as you can. Try to tame your mind from distractions. As you breathe deeply in, expand your belly and move your chest to fill your lungs. Take a deep breath through your mouth and slowly exhale. All the while staying focused on the music. 

🧘🏻‍♂️🧘🏻‍♀️🧘🏿🧘🏾‍♀️ 
Early morning Mind Rejuvenation yoga novices, meditation techniques, spiritual incantations that incorporate soothing string and wind instruments, and comforting music that can help you undergo a spiritual experience will benefit from our peaceful tunes. The objective of our effective tunes is to assist and improve relaxation, meditation, creativity, and attention.

 🪐 
Binaural beats and music tuned at a specific frequency are also used to restore a state of rest, which is great for meditation, deep sleep, and concentration. We provide a more satisfying experience for sleeplessness or insomnia through music. We provide soothing sleeping music for deep relaxation through the use of delta waves and mellow instrumental tunes. Our music is especially suitable for meditation, relaxation, and sleep music. Listen to it on headphones while you work, study, or as soothing background music. It is ideal for sleep and relaxation. As well as music for zen, it also acts as music for healing in the morning.

But I love this idea of coming in close contact with the awareness and understanding of what it feels like to bring energy to something. Often we are energizing things that are not serving us, whether it is through our thoughts, actions, our daily rituals, our habits. 

This practice gives us the tools to notice that where our attention goes… energy flows.

Today we begin with the breath of fire, to stir the pot energetically, and give you the juice you need for this rejuvenating flow. 

What are you ready to bring new energy to?

This is the third session of a series I have called; The Deep Sleep Meditation & Affirmations Series. This session focuses on Health, Healing and Happiness. Most people will fall asleep before the affirmations start. They are intentionally low in volume, but you can still hear them, however, you don't need to consciously pay attention to them. Your subconscious mind will absorb and reinforce the words while awake or in deep sleep.

Some of our actions may be too mentally draining, such as holding onto toxic relationships or pushing ourselves too hard with school or work. It can be a good idea to step back and take a look at our behaviors and habits and ask ourselves the question: do I possess healthy habits? Or negative ones? I’m sure we all have negative habits, but now it’s time to start incorporating some mentally beneficial behaviors into our routines in hopes we can develop a new habit - a good one this time. Here are a few mental health tips that boost your emotional well-being.

Mandy’s first contact with the world of addiction, mental health and recovery was when she came into treatment in 1990. Her passion for therapy and its potential for change ignited here, inspiring her to make therapy her life’s work. Alongside a growing private practice Mandy always gave time to promote early intervention through lectures on addiction, emotional coping mechanisms and self-esteem as part of the PSHE (Personal, Social & Health Education) provision within independent schools. In 2008, with a busy private practice and many years of recovery under her belt, Mandy founded CHARTER Harley Street, an outpatient centre treating addiction and trauma using her pioneering model of care.

When we strive to live a healthy life, we think mostly of losing weight, being more active, and eating healthy. While these things will all contribute to our overall wellbeing, they might not deal with some of the issues we prefer to neglect – emotional and mental health.

You might find yourself wondering why these two aspects of being human are so important if no one can really see them. But that’s exactly the point. Because we keep our feelings and emotions hidden from other people, they can become toxic over time, eventually leading to mental health issues like depression, anxiety, or panic attacks. Looking after our wellbeing and trying to live healthier is not just about the physical.

So what’s the difference between mental and emotional health?  Here you will also get to know about depression, anxiety, or panic attacks and tips on improving your emotional health. To know more watch the full video.

It is time that we extend the same empathy and aid to mental health as we do to physical health. One of the best ways to end the stigma surrounding mental health is by spreading the idea that it is always ok to take a break for your mental wellbeing, especially for teens and students. Hailey Hardcastle is a freshman at the University of Oregon and a student mental health advocate. This year she was named one of Teen Vogues 21 under 21 most influential young people for her work on passing House Bill 2191, which allows students to take mental health days off from school. Hardcastle works with other teens nationwide to promote student advocacy and come up with creative solutions to teenage mental challenges.

DBT is an incredibly useful tool when it comes to managing emotions. In fact, there is an entire module of this treatment dedicated to emotional regulation. In this interview, triple board-certified neuropsychologist Dr. Judy Ho and MedCircle host Kyle Kittleson discuss...

1. What role do emotions biologically play in our behavior and how we respond to conflict?
2. What comes first, the behavior or the emotion?
3. How can someone reduce overly emotional responses using mindfulness? 
4. What are the 3 goals of the emotional regulation model of DBT?
5. What are some examples of how we tend to be vulnerable towards emotions like sadness, denial, anger, fear, and happiness?
6. What are some ways people may incorrectly express their emotion?
7. How can someone start utilizing ""emotion words""?

Did you know that most of us spend 13 hours a day sitting down?

All of this inactivity has the potential to cause serious health problems. But, it can be hard to stay fit and healthy when you have a sedentary job. 

So, here are six tips for boosting your health and well-being at work…

1.Build activity into your commute. Why not walk, cycle or jog part of the way to work? Or, if you take public transport, get off one stop early and walk the rest of the way. 

2. Take regular screen breaks. Aim to get away from your desk for a few minutes every hour. Chat to a colleague rather than emailing them, take a phone call while standing, or take a look out of the window.

3. Use the stairs. Forget the elevator and take the stairs. Doing this will help to build up your aerobic capacity, raise your heart rate, and increase your muscle strength.

4. Hold stand-up or walking meetings. Not only will this get you up, it will make your meetings fun, creative and productive.

5. Go outside for lunch. Make an effort to leave your desk for lunch, even if it’s just for a short walk around the block. This will boost blood circulation, flex your joints, and give you time for mental recharging and reflection.

6. Eat well! To be truly effective, healthy behavior has to combine exercise and diet. So, prepare something that’s both nutritious and delicious!",0,00:02:05,Education,"['health', 'well-being', 'wellbeing', 'dangers of sitting', 'health at work', 'screen breaks', 'stress', 'workplace', 'stand-up meetings', 'walking meetings', 'fitness']",NA,youtube,NA,Enhancing well-being at work_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGlACnI7iXc,Emotional exhaustion

Some of our actions may be too mentally draining, such as holding onto toxic relationships or pushing ourselves too hard with school or work. It can be a good idea to step back and take a look at our behaviors and habits and ask ourselves the question: do I possess healthy habits? Or negative ones? I’m sure we all have negative habits, but now it’s time to start incorporating some mentally beneficial behaviors into our routines in hopes we can develop a new habit - a good one this time. Here are a few mental health tips that boost your emotional well-being.

But what if finding purpose isn’t enough to bring fulfillment? What if the focus on finding purpose, in fact, has been harming us by obscuring who we are with ideas of who we should be? This talk explores how our singular mission should be collective wellness, why now is the time to pursue it, and how the journey will offer the healing our world has desired for centuries. Chloe is an internationally acclaimed social designer, artist, and humanitarian. Fueled by an unshakable reverence for all life, her practice demands dignity for all, and centers the reimagining of societal systems to guarantee global well-being.

In this video, we discuss what healthy relationships and unhealthy relationships look like.

Relationships should be fun and exciting, but sometimes they can be tough. Resolving conflict and different wants and needs is part of having healthy relationships with friends, family, significant others, and coworkers. 

Some relationships are confusing, and it is hard to know if a relationship is healthy. A lot of it boils down to good communication and whether you can be your true self in the relationship.

If they speak to you in a disrespectful way, make you feel inferior, blame you for things that aren’t your fault, or physically or sexually hurt or harass you, that person is not good for you. 

It is ok to say “no” to people and distance yourself from them.

Healthy relationships should feel good for both people. You can only control your own behavior and you are not responsible for other people’s potentially bad behavior.

How adults handle daily routines and instructional goals impact how well children attach and respond to teachers and caregivers, which in turn affects children's feelings of security to explore their environment and make new discoveries. In this video, teachers, family child care providers, and experts discuss how adult relationships with children impact children's development, behavior, and readiness to learn. Strategies for building strong relationships with infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and Kindergartners are also shared.

It’s important to develop good relationships at work. They improve happiness, trust and engagement. Here are five ways to build strong, positive relationships at work! 

1. Schedule time to build relationships. Pop over to a colleague’s desk, offer a coffee, or reply to a social media post. Devote time to building relationships, even if it’s just a few minutes a day.

2. Develop your emotional intelligence. Understanding your own emotional needs can help you to empathize with others.

3. Appreciate others. Everyone wants to feel appreciated. Whether it’s the CEO or the janitor, show your appreciation by complimenting a job well done.

4. Manage your boundaries. Building friendships is important. But if a relationship becomes distracting, it’s important to take action. Set clear boundaries around when and where it’s acceptable to socialize.

5. Avoid gossiping. If you are experiencing conflict with a colleague, gossiping will only exacerbate the problem. Instead, talk directly to the person involved and find a way to work together amicably.

Good relationships can improve all aspects of your working life and open doors to career progression.",0,00:01:58,Education,"['work relationship', 'connection', 'networking', 'friendship', 'socialize', 'work friend', 'ally', 'communication skills']",NA,youtube,NA,Building positive relationships_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB8zoAvC8g0,Depersonalization

Mike shares three things that will help you build healthy relationships. If a couple wants to get married, that’s something we should celebrate. However, that doesn’t mean we should blindly encourage them no matter what, and offer cliche advice like, “You’re in love, and that’s all that matters,” or “Do what you heart tells you.” No matter how convincing a couple’s love for each other seems, there are some things that always need to be considered, especially in young relationships between two people who want to rush into marriage.  When it comes to relationships, there are three things Fr. Mike says to keep in mind:

There are some things only time can reveal
Let your relationship be the actual age it is
Learn how to make decisions together

There is a powerful connection between your emotions, intuition, and empathy. The magic comes when you learn how to tap into each of them to access your sensitivities without going on overload or becoming drained by challenging or stressful situations at work. Learning how to keep your center and avoid burnout in all situations is important to identify emotional triggers so you can master strategies to own the moment in your interactions.

Dr. Orloff is a psychiatrist, an empath and is on the UCLA Psychiatric Clinical Faculty. She synthesizes the pearls of traditional medicine with cutting edge knowledge of intuition, empathy, and energy awareness. She also specializes in treating empaths and highly sensitive people in her private practice and does online sessions with individuals and businesses internationally. Her work has been featured in O Magazine, Forbes, Business Insider, The London Sunday Times, CNN, The Today Show, PBS, BBC and NPR.

It’s ok if the baby falls asleep, needs to be fed, or is in a playful mood. Consider incorporating the parent into these moments for meaningful connection.

Carry this beyond the visit by:
- asking the parent for a lovey that they sleep with for a few nights so it smells like the parent
- use recorded voice story books
- get recorded videos of the parent talking to the baby or singing a song, playing peek a boo, etc.",0,00:00:54,People & Blogs,"['fostercare', 'fosterparent', 'fosterparenting']",NA,youtube,NA,Fostering meaningful connections_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isadCrAD8eQ,Depersonalization

*MAKE MEANING in the workplace—to bring out the best in everyone.
*CREATE VALUE for your employees, your customers, your company, and yourself.
*BUILD HOPE for the future by building ""the abundant organization.""

The Ulrichs' unique step-by-step system combines proven professional techniques and sharp psychological insights to bring new meaning to our work and its impact on the world outside the workplace. Filled with revealing questionnaires, checklists, interviews, and case studies, it's all you need to fully engage your team in the most challenging times—and to create a renewed sense of purpose, a sustainable source of commitment, and an environment that encourages and supports outstanding performance.

Just apply these tips in your day-to-day interactions. Whether you want to have better conversations in your personal and social life, or get your ideas across better at work, you can learn how to communicate more effectively. It’s one of the most important life skills you can have.

There are many ways to have a better communication. For example, asking questions will not only help you understand what the other person is saying, it also indicates that you're actually interested in what they’re saying. And if you want to show that you really understand, then paraphrasing is one of the simplest communication techniques you can use.

The more you pay attention to how you express yourself to others, the more you will improve your communication skills. So give it a try!

Speaking is not merely a matter of using words, but it needs a more complicated process of producing speech. Speaking is a productive skill that needs a lot of practices. In addition to listening, speaking is mostly taught to the people before reading and writing. By using spoken English, people will be able to convey their idea. Therefore, speaking is a direct route from one mind to another and is the best way to ask a question or give an explanation

It's all about deciphering the emotion and motivations underlying the data. You must be able to clearly communicate a message as well as listen in such a way that you grasp the entire meaning of what is being said and make the other person feel heard and understood.

Effective communication appears to be a natural instinct. But, all too frequently, something goes wrong when we try to communicate with others. We say one thing, but the other person hears something completely different, resulting in misunderstandings, dissatisfaction, and conflict. This can cause issues in your relationships at home, school, and at work.

Communication in relationships is very important. In this dating and relationships advice video, I share with you 7 keys to effective communication. To have a healthy and successful relationship, you need to embrace all the 7 keys to effective communication that I discuss in this relationship advice video.

Many relationships fail because of communication issues and this video will give you 7 keys to effective communication in your relationship to make your relationship better. People fail to sit down talk about their communication issues and express themselves properly. We need to learn how to talk to each other and how to listen actively and properly and these communication tips will help you improve your communication skills.

In this video, I give you relationship advice that will assist you in establishing effective communication for improving your communication skills in your relationship so that you can make your relationship better. 

One of the biggest problems is that when people try to talk to each other, the person listening is simply waiting for their chance to counter your argument. They are waiting for their chance to hit you back or to defend themselves or dismiss what you are saying and that is not going to produce healthy communication.

When someone is speaking, the goal should be to try to understand them and if you do not understand them, you go to asking for more clarity, you go to asking more questions to try to dig deeper so that you can have a clearer understanding of how they are feeling and what they are trying to communicate. 

As a certified life coach, dating coach, and relationship coach who provides relationship and dating advice for women and men, I want to make dating and relationships easier for you, and I pray that you may find this video helpful.

Now this communication thing is very interesting and not as simple as we think. Let me show you how: 

In my mind the idea is full of pictures, they are connected with memories, my learnings, my experiences. All of it if counted would amount in GBs of data.. right? 

Whereas when I tell you the idea in English (or any language), it will be just a few words. And if we count this data, it will be in a few Kilobytes at maximum. So you see how this GB-to-KB compression is happening when I tell you about my idea. 

And that's not all. If you listen to my idea, you will intake the KBs and convert them into pictures, more concepts, connect with you memories, experiences and learnings. And this again becomes GBs of data. Interesting right? 

It shows you how communication is not a simple thing and requires skill for this GB-to-KB-to-GB conversion to happen as we intend i.e for a good communication to happen. Also shows you how we should select our words carefully when we speak or write and pay a lot of attention when we listen or read",0,00:10:21,People & Blogs,[],NA,youtube,NA,Improving communication skills_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aErhdW7ouaM,Depersonalization

Improving communication skills,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8ZJSAyJ_bQ,Communication Hack for Connection & Influence | #shorts,Shadé Zahrai,unknown,1596268,79061,0,585,"What if there was a simple change you could make to communicate more collaboratively and with more influence, while also encouraging greater creativity?

There is!! You’ve got to try this!
It’s a super simple communication hack that has a HUGE impact on how others feel when they’re around you, and can have a massively positive impact on your relationships (both professional and personal!). 

Here’s why: 

The word ‘BUT’ becomes a form of psychological invalidation. It rejects, dismisses or minimises someone else's thoughts or feelings.

“I’m so sorry you feel that way, BUT…”
“That’s a great idea, BUT…”
“You’re a great team member, BUT…”

Instead, swap it for another three-letter word, and trust me - you’ll notice the difference!

Fools because they have to say something.

Sandeep Maheshwari is a name among millions who struggled, failed and surged ahead in search of success, happiness and contentment. Just like any middle class guy, he too had a bunch of unclear dreams and a blurred vision of his goals in life. All he had was an undying learning attitude to hold on to. Rowing through ups and downs, it was time that taught him the true meaning of his life.

We all have roles to play: manager, parent, friend, partner. But when one of these takes over, it’s normal to feel as if your life is out of balance. 

Absenteeism, low productivity and poor mental health - all are potential symptoms of poor work-life balance. So if you’re out of sorts, use these five tips to restore harmony.

1. Audit your time. Make a note of all your professional and personal commitments. Which ones are most valuable to you? Which are taking up too much of your time?

2. Improve your efficiency.  Limiting distractions will help you to work more productively and to focus on the tasks that really matter.

3. Add flexibility. Feeling trapped by strict working conditions? Try out the freedom of flexi-time, or working from home.

4. Find time for yourself. When you neglect your own well-being, you are no longer your best self in any part of your life. Don’t forget to set aside some “me time” every day.

5. Enjoy yourself. Time flies when you’re having fun, and the same applies to your work. An engaging workload will be more enjoyable, no matter how busy you are.

In this video, I'll share 3 tips for proper time management so you can achieve a balanced life.

""[The concept of] Work-Life Balance sets us up to strive for something that is unreachable.""

Are you struggling to find time to balance your work and personal life? In this video, we're going to explore the topic of work life balance. ""Balance"" might not be the best way to view how our work life and personal life overlap... which begs the question, is 'work life balance' a myth?

According to clinical psychologist Dr. Jenny Yip, work-life balance may be an outdated term that misrepresents the reciprocal relationship between our work life and home life. We spend so much time at work and with coworkers—they're bound to overlap. Discover why this term may be misleading, and what to do instead.

Part of replacing work life balance with life awareness and integration starts with self talk, and psychology backed self care - Dr. Jenny Yip explains the relationship and shares tips for improving self talk and self care strategies in this video.

The fact is, you are not completely wrong.

If you do want to be successful, you do need to work hard and hustle but the key is in the duration of time that you are hustling for.

Earlier this year while at our 2CCX Mastermind in Paradise event in Mexico, I gave a presentation where I explain how I achieve work life balance through periods of radical imbalance. 

In this presentation I share the two types of goals everyone should be reaching for as a business owner and/or entrepreneur. 

Once you understand the difference, you will no longer wonder how work life balance is even possible for entrepreneurs.

Are you struggling to achieve work/life balance?

So was I...

... actually, I sucked at it.

I was that guy that would show up to parties and family functions strapped to his laptop  - don’t judge :).

I self-justified with the belief that it was all o.k because I was driven and the “haters” simply didn’t get it.

This flawed mindset cost me my friendships, my relationship at the time, and my health. 

I put on 20lbs (not muscle).

The struggle was brutal.

I didn’t want to stop building and scaling companies, but I didn’t want to end up alone, sick or dead either.

And it wasn’t until after selling my company Spheric that I really took some time to reflect and ask myself if there was a better way. 

Turns out there is... a much better way.

I call it work-life integration. 

That’s what I want to share with you in today's video...

Not only do I share my approach to integrating life into work, but I also talk about the 7 pillars of life that must be kept in harmony.

Here they are:

1. Health
2. Love
3. Friends
4. Finances
5. Mission
6. Hobby
7. Spirituality

Being aware of these pillars is great. 

Integrating them into your life is where transformation truly occurs.

Watch the video to learn how I track, measure and integrate them on a weekly basis to ensure my business grows… while my health and relationships continue to thrive. 

Also, I want to share a strategy called “NET” time (stands for No Extra Time) that I use to really get the most out of my day.

(after reading over 200+ personal development and productivity books, etc. I can confidently say that you won’t find this tip anywhere else)

Dive in now and learn how to start living a deeply integrated entrepreneurial life. 

With gratitude,

– Dan

ABOUT DAN MARTELL
=====================

“You can only keep what you give away.” That’s the mantra that’s shaped Dan Martell from a struggling 20-something business owner in the Canadian Maritimes (which is waaay out east) to a successful startup founder who’s raised more than $3 million in venture funding and exited not one... not two... but three tech businesses: Clarity.fm, Spheric and Flowtown.

You can only keep what you give away. That philosophy has led Dan to invest in 33+ early stage startups such as Udemy, Intercom, Unbounce and Foodspotting. It’s also helped him shape the future of Hootsuite as an advisor to the social media tour de force. 

An activator, a tech geek, an adrenaline junkie and, yes, a romantic (ask his wife Renee), Dan has recently turned his attention to teaching startups a fundamental, little-discussed lesson that directly impacts their growth: how to scale. You’ll find not only incredible insights in every moment of every talk Dan gives - but also highly actionable takeaways that will propel your business forward. Because Dan gives freely of all that he knows. After all, you can only keep what you give away.

Lizzie and I have a crazy scenario where I'm typically all-in with work Monday thru Friday and then when it comes to weekends, I turn everything off to spend time with my wife and kids. We've also began taking a lot more vacations to make up for time ""lost"" during the week. 

The moral of the story is that we communicated from day one about how we were going to make things work. As with many things with life, communication is crucial. So, as I've said over and over again, this boils down to context. Once you understand the situation you can ""hack"" your way to making it work for everyone involved.

Job satisfaction tips,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdxtdYnSvWE,Employee motivation and job satisfaction,Stephen Goldberg,unknown,10327,54,0,2,"We all want employees to be motivated in their jobs and if we’re the employee we want to enjoy our work.

The employer’s responsibility is to make sure that the work being performed by the employee is for the most part the type of tasks that interest them. The employer also needs to provide the proper working conditions, support, compensation and rewards that meet the needs of the employee.

On the employee’s side it is the responsibility of each person to find work that interest them and choose a company that will provide the type of conditions that are motivating. You must understand yourself and know how your personal interests translate into jobs in the workplace.

Just because somebody has a skill for something doesn’t necessarily mean that they are passionate about the work. If you want to get the best out of people you need to align what they’re good at with what they most enjoy doing.

For example a classic error made by many companies is to promote the best employee to be a manager or supervisor. Take an employee who sells complex computer hardware solutions to large companies and whose interests are mainly associated with selling, technology and creativity. This person might excel at their job of helping clients solve complex problems, but put that person into a management role and he or she might fail. The management role in this case would require someone with high interests in people, as one of the main tasks of a manager is to develop others so that the department can perform and grow. Without the people interest the new manager might continue to override his salespeople because his skills and interests lie more in problem-solving in creative ways that produce a sales result rather than and coaching and training the salespeople to perform at a higher level.

Self-understanding

To better understand ones key interests requires some self-reflection or an assessment tool. When hiring people an assessment tool can be extremely useful to get a quick and valid understanding of what someone’s interests are.

I use the Profile XT (http://www.profilesinternational.com/employee-assessment-products-overview/profilext-personality-assessment-test/) and the Profile Sales Assessment (http://www.profilesinternational.com/employee-assessment-products-overview/profiles-sales-assessment/) to provide greater understanding of people. These tools cover six interest areas; enterprising, people, technical, financial/ administrative, creative and mechanical. The assessment tool determines the top three interest areas of the person and compares that to the requirements of the position.

Take Stock of your Interests

Another approach to understanding your interests is to write down the things you do that interests you the most and the things that you dislike the most at work or at home. For example I enjoy anything that allows me to be creative both when it comes to business as well as artful pursuits. I also enjoy business and have turned hobbies into businesses. I know I dislike administrative work as I tend to procrastinate and avoid those tasks. I particularly like to help others solve problems that will help them be more successful. Thus it makes sense for me to be a coach and trainer helping people solve business problems in creative ways.

Although it is extremely important that we have the right skills for the job if we really enjoy and are passionate about the work, we will be much more fulfilled and successful. This will translate into better performance and rewards for ourselves and our company.

Job satisfaction tips,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6Meb_VByLg,What is Employee Satisfaction | Employee Satisfaction Surveys | Employee Feedback Forms,SurveySparrow,unknown,6234,78,0,0,"Employee satisfaction is, quite simply, how content employees are with their jobs in an organization. 

Companies need to keep their employees happy and reduce turnover.

Employee Satisfaction is typically measured using employee feedback forms, and factors that influence these might include:

Compensation, workload, perceptions of management, flexibility,  teamwork, resources etc. 

With regular feedback opportunities in place, employers can monitor employee happiness and see where they need to make changes to improve the workplace experience for everyone.

Employee satisfaction surveys can be conducted in person or online, either in a closed setting or an open-ended format.

During an employee survey, you can quickly get a sense of how well your employees are doing by asking them questions about what's working and what isn't. 

Employee satisfaction surveys will also help you figure out exactly where your company needs improvement. 

And this can fix those areas before they become problems for everyone involved in the business.

The more insight you have into your employees' feelings, the better equipped you are to nurture their happiness and satisfaction with your organization.

Since employee satisfaction is such an important metric, it's helpful to know whether or not you're meeting benchmarks.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

This is how I became a software developer with no experience, how i became an interior designer with no experience, and how i started on youtube. I quit ""my dream job"" as an actor and have been so much happier since. If you have ever wondered ""Should i quit my job"", ""Is it worth a paycut"" or ""What will people say about me""...I have lots of thoughts to share with you.

I wanted to make this video because I find myself having this conversation with so many friends, family members and even strangers -- The Great Resignation is among us. Something is in the air, and if you are miserable in your work or in your life...there is another way. 

Change is hard. But slowly and imperceptibly, things do change. And they can change for the better. 

I think I'll be doing videos in the future going into greater depth on how I got into each of these individual careers. So leave any questions you have in the comments and I'll cover more in a future video!

Thanks for indulging 40 straight minutes of me yelling. 
Lots of love,

Setting and achieving goals,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1F7EEGPQwo,The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals | Huberman Lab Podcast #55,Andrew Huberman,unknown,1185366,30521,0,1650,"In this episode, I discuss the science of setting, assessing, and pursuing goals. I explain the neural (brain) circuits that underlie goal setting and pursuit. Then I describe nine science-supported tools anyone can apply toward their goals. I explain when and how to use goal visualization, when to use multitasking and how to use specific rewards to improve the likelihood of reaching your goals. I also explain why envisioning failures and their consequences are effective and how to set goals of the appropriate level of challenge. I also explain how the molecule dopamine is used to gauge our progress toward milestones and long-term overarching goals and how to leverage dopamine for goal pursuit. Finally, I explain a unique tool called 'space-time bridging' that can be used to support all aspects of goal setting, assessment, and pursuit. This episode ought to be useful for anyone seeking to improve their performance in work, school, exercise, athletics, or personal development.

Dr. Balcetis’ research focuses on how our perception of the world, particularly our visual perceptions, influences our level and persistence of motivation, how we conceptualize goals, actual goal achievement, and our emotional state as we pursue goals. Dr. Balcetis explains how to best visualize and overcome challenges in pursuit of larger, complex goals. We also discuss the science of how to define goals and intermediate milestones, overcome obstacles, and effectively track progress. This episode highlights science-based, immediately actionable tools that anyone can use to set and achieve physical and/or cognitive goals more effectively.

In this practical talk, Doerr shows us how we can get back on track with ""Objectives and Key Results,"" or OKRs -- a goal-setting system that's been employed by the likes of Google, Intel and Bono to set and execute on audacious goals. Learn more about how setting the right goals can mean the difference between success and failure -- and how we can use OKRs to hold our leaders and ourselves accountable.

Goal Setting is not difficult if it is done properly.  So watch this video if you want to set and achieve your most precious goals. 

The problem is everyone wants life to be greater but almost all of us get stuck at times or something prevents us from doing what we really are capable of doing whether shifting a relationship, turning around our finances, getting in proper shape. Instead of being happy, we get stuck with the belief of how we are not supposed to be, what we are not supposed to do, what we are not capable of. We are stuck in the emotional pattern of being pissed off or being frustrated. Sometimes we are stuck in our habits of doing things in certain ways and that is because we lack proper planning and proper motivation to achieve our goals. 

So the first step to achieve your goals is knowing yourself. 
Step 2 is to set your goals. 
Step 3 is to create short term goals
Step 4 is to be consistent.

Some define him as an expert institutional investor, while others know him as a large scale installation artist, avid outdoorsman, professor, decision strategist, coach, business leader, mindfulness extremist, author, speaker, daredevil or Guinness world record holder. In his talk, Stephen explains that what truly defines him aren't titles, but an approach to decision making that transformed him from someone who struggled with simple tasks to a guy who is continuously achieving even his most ambitious dreams.

For thirty years, he has applied cognitive science to investing, business and life. The result has been the turnaround of numerous institutional businesses, career best returns for managers who have adopted his methods, the development of a $1.25 billion dollar hedge fund and a rapidly shrinking bucket list.
Mr. Duneier teaches graduate courses on Decision Analysis in UCSB’s College of Engineering. His book, AlphaBrain is due for release in early 2017 from Wiley & Sons.
Through Bija Advisors, he helps business leaders improve performance by applying proven, proprietary decision-making methods to their own processes.
His artwork has been featured around the world and is represented by the Sullivan Goss Gallery. As Commissioner of the League of Professional Educators, Duneier is using cognitive science to alter the landscape of American education. He is the former Head of Currency Option Trading at Bank of America and Emerging Markets at AIG International.

This Reiki session is intended to remove all the energy blockages that are hindering you from achieving your goals.


Being in a sleep, awake, occupied or engaged in other activities while simultaneously  receiving Reiki, will never impair from its effectiveness. 
Reiki always works for your highest good and most benevolent outcomes.

The infinite wisdom of Reiki flows only where it is desired, affecting matter at subtle levels. Your personal acceptance and openness to receiving this healing energy will dictate the level of energy to receive.

You are encouraged to play this distance healing recording repeatedly as often as you wish. This Reiki sessions can have cumulative effects, meaning, the healing energy infused in these videos is amplified each time you play it.

Each of us has our unique response to the healing energy and our experience can indeed vary from session to session. It depends on how sensitive someone is to energy. Just relax and enjoy this healing energy flowing to you.

This is a ""real time"" Reiki session recorded from the beginning to end.  While channeling energy my focused and devoted attention will prevail throughout the session. Therefore, I do not speak and remain silent at all times. Soothing background music is used to further promote deeper relaxation during the session. 

In order for Reiki to work effectively, please be open to receiving the healing energy.
It is extremely beneficial to drink water after receiving Reiki as part of the healing process. 


Important Note: Treatment with Energy Healing such as Reiki - does not promise to cure any illness or condition nor replaces professional medical treatment.

I did everything possible to ensure that you really enjoy this Free Reiki Video Session and I will do everything in my power, in case you need any help. However, I want to put here clearly that I do not perform miracles and I do not promise to cure anyone. In critical situations, please, use your common sense and help yourself first by seeking qualified professional help. 

My services may be useful for many but not for everyone, so I wanted to emphasize that there are no promises, guarantees or representations that you will attain cure of any condition nor win or earn any money as a result of using any of my services. The use of any of my information, products and services should always be based on your own diligence, and you agree that I am not responsible in any way for your success nor failure. I am merely the facilitator who transmits channeled energy to you. Everything here mentioned is “energetically speaking” and that is the sole basis of my work.

---TRANSCRIPT---
Thanks for stopping by, this is 2 Minute Classroom and today we are talking about setting goals using the SMART method. 

Goal setting is a great activity anytime but is especially popular around New Years', at the start of the school year, and the beginning of a sports season. I would love to hear some of your goals in the comments and I’ll put some of mine in the description below. 
 
SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

We’ll go through each of these using the example goal of “doing well on your next exam” - A common goal for students.

The first step is to make the goal specific. “Doing well on your next exam” is not specific. Try to answer the questions of what, when, and why.

Let’s specify your what as scoring at least 90% on your next science exam.

For the when it will be whenever the exam is, let’s say it’s in 4 weeks.

The why is very important as this is your motivation for the goal and something you can look back on if you get discouraged. 

It could be to improve your grade in the course, to score higher than a friend, or because you want to get into a great university. Whatever will motivate you to keep working on the goal. 

So now we have a much more specific goal “Score at least 90% on the next science exam four weeks from now to help you get into a great university.” 

This goal is looking great, but we are not done yet. 

The next step is to make sure the goal is measurable. That means there are some metrics attached to the goal to let you know if you reach your goal or not. 

Looking back at our goal we see that it is to score at least 90%. This is very measurable and once you’ve taken the test and received a score you will know whether or not you hit the goal. 

This is also why “Doing well on your next exam” is a poor goal - it is not measurable and there is no clear way to define success or failure. 

The next step is to check whether the goal is achievable or not. In this step you want to break the goal down and answer the question of “how” you will achieve this goal. What do you need to do in the next four weeks to get at least 90% on the exam. 

Some examples may include taking notes in class, spending 30 minutes three nights per week studying for the exam, and partnering with a friend a week before the exam to review notes and go through a study guide. 

The point is you need a plan. Break the goal down into smaller goals that all feed up to the main goal. This will give you a clear path to success.

The fourth step is to ensure the goal is relevant. 

This step is more of a gut check to see if it fits well in your life right now. Ask yourself the following questions: Does this align with my long-term objectives? Does it keep me on track for other goals in your life? Will focusing on this goal pull me away from other, more important goals?

After thinking through this step you should feel confident your goal is relevant and be even more motivated to achieve it. 

Scoring at least 90% on your next science exam is relevant because it will give you confidence in school and feed into larger goals around future education and career. 

The last step is to make the goal time-bound. 

A time-bound deadline acts as a target and helps you work backward and set smaller steps to get there. If you set a fitness goal to be able to do 100 consecutive pushups but don’t set a deadline to reach that goal then it probably won't happen.

Hitting a certain score on an exam is time-bound by default because there is a specific date for the exam which allows us to break the goal into smaller steps leading up to the exam. 

And here is a bonus tip. If you truly want to reach your goals then you have to write them down and look at them often. I recommend keeping a daily/weekly planner to track your progress. I’ve put some excellent planner recommendations in the description that will help make your goals a reality. 

Remember to share your goals in the comments, I will read and respond to as many of them as I can.

Raise your hand if this describes you: You start working toward a new goal with excitement, only to watch it eventually fizzle out to nothing. If you’re human, it’s likely you’ve experienced this phenomenon. Why is it some goals are just so hard to accomplish, whereas others we’re able to conquer with ease?


On today’s episode of The BiggerPockets Podcast, that’s exactly what you’ll discover. Diving deep into psychological research on goals, motivation, and time management, Brandon and David will pull back the curtain on how people set and accomplish big goals and give you a GPS toward changing your life forever.

Enhancing motivation at work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hPh5k8Xeeg,7 Methods to Motivate Your Team - See Motivation Improve Quickly,Enhance.training,unknown,6766,144,0,6,"7 methods to motivate your team gives you practical actionable methods to motivate a team which work with all teams.

Knowing how to motivate a team is a great skill for any manager to have and everyone can learn how to motivate. Engaged and motivated teams perform a lot better and are much nicer places to work – great for everyone.

So the first method to motivate a team is to share your vision with your team. Explain the direction and goals you want to achieve. Explain how this fits in with the company goals and why each team member has an important role to play. 

The second way to motivate your team is to understand the goals of each team member. Everyone is different and have different hopes and dreams. Take each person through how achieving the company and team goals can also help the individual achieve some of their goals. 

Leading by example is another way for motivating your team at work. I always found it very motivational being in a team with a hardworking successful manager who lives by the same rules they set for everyone. Leading by example is great for how to motivate and inspire employees.


How to motivate team members as a leader includes actively developing team members. There are so many ways to develop team members without needing a large budget. Plan out what you can do to move each person in your team forward and keep them learning.

When thinking to ways to motivate your team, praising regularly should feature highly. We all want praise for work well done and as a manager, look for opportunities to praise employees. Positive reinforcement really does work. 

The sixth method to motivate a team is to proactively remove blockers. Having to fight against blockers is painful and demotivating. Look at your processes. Deal with conflict and underperformers. Deal with disruptive staff. Take action.

Seventh, for how to motivate employees – practice a positive management style. There are many behaviours and actions that go into a positive management style – some we have covered already. Additional ones include promoting open communication, being consistent and spending time listening to your team members. These are all great actions to motivate your team

Put into practice at least one of the methods outlined in “7 methods to Motivate your team”. Once you have this up and running, put into action the next one. It won’t be long before you have them all running, and you will quickly see the impact on team motivation.

Enjoy working with a more motivated team!

Huberman is a McKnight Foundation and Pew Foundation Fellow and was awarded the Cogan Award in 2017, given to the scientist making the most significant discoveries in the study of vision. His lab’s most recent work focuses on the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. He also works on neural regeneration and directs a clinical trial to promote visual restoration in diseases that cause blindness. Huberman is also actively involved in developing tools now in use by the elite military in the U.S. and Canada, athletes, and technology industries to optimize performance in high stress environments, enhance neural plasticity, mitigate stress, and optimize sleep. 

Work from the Huberman Laboratory at Stanford School of Medicine has been published in top journals including Nature, Science, and Cell and has been featured in TIME, BBC, Scientific American, Discover, and other top media outlets.

Goal Hierarchy
Goals  Objectives (Small Goals/Why)‏  Skills (How) & Knowledge (What/Why)‏
Goals are the overarching reason a person begins to do something.  
Often goals are broad and abstract. ""I want to be healthier.""  ""I want to be happy.""
Goals need to be broken down into manageable, meaningful, observable objectives.
Phrase goals as adding a positive instead of removing a negative.
One way to elicit goals is through the miracle question:  If you woke up tomorrow and you were _____ (i.e. your problem was resolved/goal was achieved) what would be different?
This gives you insight into the foundations of this particular persons symptoms/definition of the problem.
Objectives need to be put into measurable terms. Frequency, Intensity, Duration
Objectives are small goals that can usually be achieved in 1-3 monthsThey combine to make the ultimate goal a reality.  
Skills & Knowledge  If you believe that people do the best they can with the tools they have at any given time, then you understand that your client now needs to learn how to change.
The Hook, A.K.A. The 5 Ws 
Who is responsible for doing What, When, Where, Why and How
This is your client's action plan or map 
Who (your client)‏
What are they responsible for doing, when and where
Why are they doing it
How is it helping them meet their ultimate goal
Behavior Modification
Behavioran observable, measurable event
Reinforcer something that increases the frequency of a behavior
Reinforcing a quality that ensures the repetition of a behavior
Punishment something that decreases the frequency of a behavior
Punishing a quality that ensures the reduction of a behavior
Contingency If x then y
POINTS
We only do things in which the reinforcers (positive) outweigh the punishments (negative).
It is vital not only to ask why a person wants to change, but also why he/she does not want to change.

Behavior Strain  too much punishment/work without sufficient reward
Too long between initiation of behavior and reward
Using Behavior Modification
Treatment/Action Plan Activity
Write one of the most common reasons people come to see you
Turn that into an observable/measurable goal
Break the goal into 3-5 objectives that clearly state the 5 Ws
What is to be done
Who will do it
When will it be done
Why will it be done
Where will it be done
How (if applicable)‏
Motivation Multidimensional
Emotional—I want to
Intellectual-- I need to
Behavioral-- I am
Learning Styles
Global/Sequential
Start with an overview
Follow an outline
Auditory/Visual/Kinesthetic
Say it
Write it/Read it

I describe how dopamine, a chemical we all make in our brain, underlies our desire for and pursuit of our goals, as well as our capacity to move and experience pleasure. I describe how we can leverage specific behaviors, reward schedules and dopamine-prolactin balance to help ensure we can maintain motivation and capacity for pleasure over the long term. I also discuss dopamine in the context of ADHD, craving and addiction, and some absolutely amazing results about specificity of drug effects based purely on belief.

I discuss the immensely powerful chemical that we all make in our brain and body: dopamine. I describe what it does and the neural circuits involved. I explain dopamine peaks and baselines, and the cell biology of dopamine depletion. I include 14 tools for how to control your dopamine release for sake of motivation, focus, avoiding and combating addiction and depression, and I explain why dopamine stacking with chemicals and behaviors inevitably leads to states of underwhelm and poor performance. I explain how to achieve sustained increases in baseline dopamine, compounds that injure and protect dopamine neurons including caffeine from specific sources. I describe non-prescription supplements for increasing dopamine—both their benefits and risks—and synergy of pro-dopamine supplements with those that increase acetylcholine.

--

Socrates, one of the founding fathers of Western philosophical thought, was on trial. Many believed he was an enemy of the state, accusing the philosopher of corrupting the youth and refusing to recognize their gods. But Socrates wasn’t feared for claiming to have all the answers, but rather, for asking too many questions. Erick Wilberding digs into the technique known as the Socratic Method.

Opportunities and barriers at each stage can be different for women or minorities, but knowing the challenges can help overcome them - and create change for self and others on the road to success and happiness. 
Rosabeth Moss Kanter wrote her first novel at the age of 11. Not one to rest on her childhood laurels, Kanter’s ambition and fierce intellect earned her a BA in sociology and English Literature from Bryn Mawr, followed by an MA and PhD in Sociology from the University of Michigan. Her dissertation on 19th-century utopian communities set the stage for a long and incredibly distinguished career in business research and academia. Kanter taught at Brandeis, Harvard and Yale before joining the faculty at Harvard Business School as the Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor of Business and director and chair of the Harvard University Advanced Leadership Initiative. A prolific writer, Kanter has published numerous books on business management, gender and race in the workplace. She served as economic adviser to Michael Dukakis during the 1988 presidential election, co- founded Goodmeasure, Inc. a consulting firm that counts IBM and British Airways among its clients, and was the last academic to edit the Harvard Business Review. Kanter’s numerous accolades include 23 honorary degrees, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and an award in her name, which recognizes the best in work-family research.

Cook spoke as part of his class reunion at the school.(www.fuqua.duke.edu)

APPLE CEO AND FUQUA ALUM TIM COOK TALKS LEADERSHIP AT DUKE

Tim Cook spoke to students and alums when he returned for his 25th reunion



""Explore everything. Push the corners of your mind. Just get on this kind of continual learning roller coaster and see what happens.""

This was among the advice Apple CEO Tim Cook shared with students at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business on April 26th. Back on campus for his 25-year reunion, Cook took part in an hour-long dialogue with Fuqua Dean Bill Boulding and the students in a jam-packed Geneen Auditorium buzzing with excitement to hear from the leader of the world's most profitable company.

The Apple CEO has embarked on a career far different than he had envisioned after graduating from Fuqua's Evening Executive MBA program in 1988. ""For me the journey was not predictable at all. You have to find your own north star and stay with your north star.""

As 450 Daytime MBA students prepared to graduate, Cook advised the students to heed Abraham Lincoln's words of wisdom: ""I will prepare and someday my chance will come.""

Cook shared the three keys to his leadership at Apple: people, strategy, and execution. ""If you get those three right the world is a great place.""

Students were able to get a unique glimpse into Cook's motivation, inspiration and leadership role models. Raised in the south and a witness to racial injustice, Cook described his admiration for Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Junior's bravery in risking their lives to fight for what they believed in. He has just three photos in his office: two of Kennedy and one of King.

Cook was asked when to follow strict principles of business theory and when to break the rules. His response stressed the importance of risks and learning from failure. ""You should rarely follow the rules. What Fuqua teaches you so well is how to learn and how to collaborate. Write your own rules.""

This message resonated with first-year MBA student Shelby Hall. ""I know this follows Steve Jobs' belief that Apple creates products which consumers didn't ever know existed,"" she said. ""It was interesting to hear Tim Cook's perspective on how we should balance writing our own rules while applying the foundations of business taught here at Fuqua.""

Cook also spoke about some of his recollections from Fuqua. ""The people made it an incredible experience. It was great for me to see how bright people approached solutions in different ways.""

First-year MBA student Juan Danzilo says Cook's willingness to share his experiences shows a deep commitment to Fuqua. ""Tim Cook's presence reflects Fuqua's sense of community. His humility and eloquence is admirable. It certainly was a unique opportunity for MBA students to hear from such an inspirational leader.""",0,00:02:51,Education,"['Duke', 'University', 'Duke University', 'Fuqua', 'School', 'Business', 'The Fuqua School of Business', 'MBA', 'Durham', 'NC', 'Apple', 'CEO', 'Tim', 'Cook', 'Tim Cook', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Intuition', 'Collaboration', 'Ethics', 'Rules', 'Leadership', 'Lead', 'Inspire', 'Inspirational', 'Bill Boulding', 'iphone', 'ipad', 'itunes', 'ipod', 'tablet', 'smart phone', 'Apple Inc.

Learn about 6 actions to drive retention, motivation, and performance. 

Creating a career development plan takes some thought and putting the career plan into action takes effort. Career planning is good for you, the team and the individual.

Career development proactively helps the employee to learn new skills and gain new experience which helps them deliver more for the company in which they work. Retaining staff makes all the investments you have made in the staff even more worthwhile, and you get the benefits of their increased skills for longer.

Writing an effective career plan requires at least 6 actions. The first is helping the team member decide on where they want to take their career. i.e. What is their professional goal. Without a goal, it is hard to work out where their career is heading and therefore how to help them. 

Once they have chosen a goal, the next step is working out all the steps between where they are now and where they want to get to. Create a career map to capture all the career development roles available on the route.

I recommend choosing to focus on the next two role along your prepared career route so that you have a career development plan covering the next 5 years. 
Fourth, Get the team member to spend time researching the skills, experience and qualifications needed for the next two roles. I suggest several effective ways of doing this.

Then look at the gap between where they are now and the skills etc they need to progress to the next role for their career development. Look at the specific gaps and the scale of those gaps. 

Finally, you are in a position to assign projects, tasks, activities i.e. the actions that will help the employee develop their career towards their career goals. I take you briefly through 11 different ways of helping your employee build their skills and experience.

You will know what to put in a career development plan, have plenty of tips on how to put it into practice and hopefully more committed and motivated employees with building skills to help the company be even more successful.
