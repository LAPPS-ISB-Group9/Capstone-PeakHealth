He feels like he's at the end of his tether every day. To cope with this stress, Vikrant should start by creating better work-life balance for himself. He should prioritize his own mental and physical health and take time out from work to unwind and relax. He should also take up hobbies like reading, gardening, or exercising. Spending quality time with friends and family can also help him in managing his stress levels. He could also try out stress-reduction techniques like meditation and mindfulness.

To manage his emotions and stress levels, Vikrant takes regular breaks and utilizes mindfulness techniques to stay grounded and focused.

He also never feels at the end of his patience or uncaring about his team/colleagues at the end of his work day. He does, however, feel as if he has become more insensitive to people in the workplace a few times per year. Given his profession, age group, and gender, the best strategy for Vikrant to combat his depersonalization is to focus on creating meaningful connections with his colleagues and team members. He should make an effort to connect with them on a personal level, engaging in conversations about topics beyond work. Additionally, he should take regular breaks throughout the day, allowing himself to reset and refocus.
