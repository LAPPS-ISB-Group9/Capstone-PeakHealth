About TEDx, x = independently organized event

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)","0","00:20:36",Nonprofits & Activism,"{""tedx talks"",tedx,ted,TEDx,TEDxPocklington,""ted talks"",""tedx talk"",English,UK,""ted x"",""ted talk""}",NA,youtube,NA,Managing emotional well-being_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04NKrbm9zW8,Emotional exhaustion

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)","0","00:08:45",Nonprofits & Activism,"{""Career/Life Development"",""ted x"",tedx,""ted talks"",Development/Philanthropy,""United States"",Business,TEDxTalks,Economics,""ted talk"",English,""tedx talks"",""tedx talk"",ted}",NA,youtube,NA,Goal setting and achievement_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MYY8qMWQg,Personal achievement

Building positive relationships,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=170nnuEGj84,How to build positive relationships at work and at home with Dr. Sohee Jun,Alex D. Tremble,unknown,"1236","4",0,"0","Wonder how to build positive relationships at work at home? Dr. Sohee Jun discusses tips to encourage you. 

As a top leadership coach, keynote speaker, leadership development expert and Amazon best-selling author, Dr.Jun works with emerging leaders and executives to unleash their untapped power for themselves and their teams. 

Sohee works with world-renowned Fortune 500 companies in entertainment, production & media, start-ups, gaming, financial services, and engineering -- helping identify and strategically capitalize upon moments of shift and challenge as opportunities for powerful growth and change.

Most recently, Sohee served as Executive Director of Organization and development and Change Management at Warner Bros. Entertainment.

MAIN TAKEAWAYS:

* There’s more success when you have fun with your work.

* All healthy relationships are transactional. Dr. Jun asks about the definition of transactional  and if it is just a 1:1 interaction.  Transactional means being willing to give of yourself in a healthy way and there’s a value in the exchange.

* There’s more room for giving when building relationships, but if it’s not reciprocated for too long in the workplace, the value shifts and the employee can feel like it’s not worth it.

* In the workplace, employees are the givers in the relationship but leaders must ask, do their employees  get value from them in the transactional relationship? It may not always be monetary, but can be kudos and appreciation. 

* Time and value are the best things to give in a relationship and it applies to the leader/employee relationship. Leaders must ask how they can provide support and help employees grow in their career. This is valuable to workers.

* There are layoffs but it’s talent that companies want to keep due to their assets and they want to ask those players what they value in an intentional and purposeful way.

* How do you decide how to give someone what they need vs what they want when it comes to value? Dr. Jun comes upon this often in coaching and handles it by saying “yes” to what they want but “and” to what they need to support them better. “Yes, … and…” statements give them both. 

* Listening creates a level of validation. Feeling heard and understood can help shift mindset. Introducing other options and solutions may be easier to absorb.

* The hardest thing is to look inward and see how you are centered and grounded, what’s your intention and if it’s not aligning what’s the next step? 

* Change is a process that occurs over time. It’s a progression that takes us being willing to forget ourselves. 

* Forget and forgive yourself. We can be harsh in how we perform and hard on ourselves when we misstep. We have to catch ourselves and then do better. 

* When you know better do better. There’s no reason to stress out. If you did the best you can don’t stress out. But also ask yourself, “Did I do the best I can do?” or “Did I do the best I was willing to do?” Do we challenge ourselves or blame people and obstacles for our failures? 

* We have to know our obstacles and know our goals. We must be willing to push ourselves to achieve our goals. 

* As minorities, there are obstacles, but moving forward in an intentional way where you have agency and extreme ownership in the situation will help you achieve success.

* Intentionality in refusing to allow anything to stop you from reaching your goals is how minority leaders can set their mindset.

* As a leader, you use the same concept for employees. Meet them where their unique personality is and tweak your style just a little for them.

Building meaningful connections,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22zzg6DHw08,Overcoming Loneliness and Isolation to Build Meaningful Connections,Maitreya Fields,unknown,"4414","226",0,"51","Website: https://www.maitreyastore.com/

Loneliness and isolation are some of the most insidious emotions that a person can harbor within themselves. Like a consuming black hole, they can drain a person's life energy and desire to live. Many people experience moments of feeling lonely at certain stages of their lives, while others feel a sense of emptiness and loneliness within themselves for their entire lives, and nothing seems to help them escape that feeling. The latter type of people have become energetically detached from all other people and sometimes even from themselves.

It is important to distinguish between a person being alone and feeling lonely. When a person is alone, they can feel happy and cheerful despite the absence of other people, whereas lonely people may be surrounded by many people but still feel disconnected and constantly detached from the world.

Loneliness can often be caused by struggling to communicate freely with others. This is usually due to a past trauma that makes the person constantly fearful and makes them believe that they won't be accepted by others. Over time, the person becomes more and more cautious about what they say, thinks excessively of the impression he made, and may even interpret certain words and reactions from others as attacks on themselves or feel guilty without any real reason.

Often, people who suffer from loneliness underestimate their condition, but our DNA has been programmed over millions of years to give us a strong urge to belong to a group. This is because, in the past, being rejected by one's tribe meant a certain death and was the biggest fear for humans. Nowadays, while this is not the case anymore, and a person can survive alone without a tribe, the neural connections that have hardwired this pattern create real emotional, mental, and even physical pain.

This field is designed to bring you out of the state of loneliness and heal and release the reasons that created it in your current life.
It works to transform the emotions that have caused you to isolate yourself from others and the world.

- It clears traumatic memories and gives you a higher perspective on your emotions and beliefs, which will help you ""step back"" from yourself and be able to look at yourself as a neutral observer.
- It removes the fear of communication with others.
- It removes the feeling that someone is attacking you and gives you a proper view and assessment of reality that is not distorted by your previous traumas.
- It removes all illusions that you have created for yourself, such as believing that something is wrong with you, you may do something wrong, you will be judged, treated rudely, or rejected.
- It gives you the courage and bravery to open your heart again to others and the world, giving you an inner feeling of safety and security.
- It gives you a higher perspective on the world, which will help you see and feel the interconnection of all things.
- It gives you a state of your NEW SELF, which can freely communicate and connect with yourself, others, and the world with ease.

3. How can someone reduce overly emotional responses using mindfulness? 
4. What are the 3 goals of the emotional regulation model of DBT?

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)","0","00:16:59",Nonprofits & Activism,"{tedx,""English Language (Human Language)"",""ted x"",""tedx talks"",""Nova Scotia (Canadian Province)"",Best,Training,""Halifax (City/Town/Village)"",Business,""Olympic Games (Broadcast Genre)"",""tedx talk"",Performance,Personal,""TED (Organization)"",""Karen Furneaux"",""Mount Saint Vincent University (Organization)"",TEDx,Live,""ted talk"",TEDxMSVUWomen,ted,""Kayaking (Sport)"",""Canada (Country)"",""ted talks"",Success}",NA,youtube,NA,Empowerment self at work_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvRcrErELY,Personal achievement

Fatigue describes a state of tiredness that does not resolve with rest or sleep.[1] In general usage, fatigue is synonymous with extreme tiredness or exhaustion that normally follows prolonged physical or mental activity. When it does not resolve after rest or sleep, or occurs independently of physical or mental exertion, it may be a symptom of a medical condition that may become severe or progressive.[2]

Fatigue can be a feature of a mental disorder such as depression; may be associated with conditions of chronic pain such as fibromyalgia; it may also feature in conditions of chronic low-level inflammation, and be a disease-related symptom in many other conditions.[3] Fatigue often has no known cause, and is recognised as being very complex in nature.[4] Fatigability describes a susceptibility to fatigue.[5]

Physical fatigue results from muscle fatigue brought about by intense physical activity.[6][7][8] Mental fatigue results from prolonged periods of cognitive activity which impairs cognitive ability. Mental fatigue can manifest as sleepiness, lethargy, or directed attention fatigue.[9] Mental fatigue can also impair physical performance.[10]","0","00:03:11",People & Blogs,{},NA,youtube,NA,Mental exhaustion_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyXVuO2Arc,Emotional exhaustion

Self-care is something I give a lot of thought to and make sure to prioritize in my life. While I'm not a big fan of labels, I do have anxiety from time to time and can easily feel overwhelmed. Whether I want to care about my physical, emotional or mental health, these top 10 self-care practices help keep me feeling my best.

Some of these practices are daily while others are weekly or monthly. Just because something works for me doesn't mean it will work for you and I'm always looking to add things to my routine to feel better. Please watch until the end because self-care tip #10 is the most important one and I'll probably make a separate video on this in the future.

How do you practice self-care? How do you take care of your mental health and overall well being? Let me know in the comments below.

The animation industry is notorious for the extreme deadlines and long hours, which all add up to stress and declining mental health.

So here are some tried and tested methods to managing stress and anxiety and avoiding burnout in your job. These tips can apply to any job really but since this is a channel focusing mostly on animation and creative work, and I am a professional animator.... I'll focus on animation.

I address how to manage your workload, manage your time, manage your health, and manage your anxiety. 

Hope these stress management techniques help you to avoid burnout and take care of your mental health!

Stress is something you feel when you either have
- a lot of things going on at once
- an important decision to make
- an unexpected change in your life
- a big event coming up
- or when something really dangerous or terrifying happens to you. 
 
Stress is something that everyone experiences.  Feeling some amount of stress is normal.  When your level of stress gets to be too much, that's when it can turn into a problem.

Humans are wired for connections and when we connect with others at an emotional level, we feel positive, needed, and most of all happy – the feelings that we strive hard to achieve throughout our existence.  

The external influences of social media and mobile phones have made us pretty much forget the joy of building and nurturing friendships. The digital relationships are beginning to affect our personal relationships, even with our near and dear ones.

In this video, Meera Murthy talks about three simple behaviors you can adopt to build meaningful connections that can enrich your lives. Create magic in your relationships and friendships by integrating these easy steps and enjoy meaningful connections that will last forever.

🔷Retinal detachment🔷
🔶Surgical Case Series🔶

🟢 Pneumatic retinopexy is a minimally invasive, non-incisional procedure for repairing retinal detachment. 
🟢 It consists of injecting an expandable gas and applying retinal cryotherapy or laser photocoagulation to seal retinal breaks.
🟢 The technique of repairing retinal detachments by retinopexy followed by gas endotamponade was first described by Rosengren in 1938.
🟢 However, this method was not widely practiced until after the publication of Hilton and Grizzard’s seminal paper in 1986, in which they describe what we recognize as modern pneumatic retinopexy.
🟢 This procedure is associated with reduced morbidity, reduced cost and faster postoperative recovery compared to pars plana vitrectomy and scleral buckling. 
🟢 Superior visual acuity outcomes have also been reported. 
🟢 Intraoperative complications are primarily related to the intraocular pressure rise caused by gas injection, or the misdirection of the gas. 
🟢 There is a low rate of postoperative complications. Anatomic success rates of over 90% can be achieved when strict selection criteria are applied. 
🟢 However, a number of studies have revealed good outcomes in cases with expanded clinical indications. 
🟢 Pneumatic retinopexy is currently underutilized. 
🟢 With appropriate patient selection, a high success rate can be achieved, and therefore, this procedure has an important role in the armamentarium of the vitreoretinal surgeon.

🔴 Technique:
🔷 Preoperative
👉Clinical examination and identification of retinal breaks.
🔷 Anesthesia
👉 The eye is anesthetized with topical proxymetacaine.
👉 Sub-Tenon injection of 2% lidocaine.
🔷 Procedure.
👉 Visualize retinal breaks with the binocular indirect ophthalmoscope.
👉 Apply transconjunctival cryopexy to the retinal breaks.
👉 Perform anterior chamber paracentesis.
👉 0.2 mL of aqueous is aspirated using a 27 G needle
Inject intraocular gas bubble.
👉 0.5–0.6 mL of pure SF6 is injected via the pars plana using a 30 G needle.
👉 Visualize the optic nerve head.
👉 If it is not perfused, repeat the paracentesis.
🔷 Postoperative
👉 The patient is asked to posture continuously for 7 days.
👉 The patients is re-examined on the first postoperative day If the retina is flat on post-op day 1, the patient is re-examined at 1 week.

As the new documentary Resilience reveals, toxic stress can trigger hormones that wreak havoc on the brains and bodies of children, putting them at a greater risk for disease, homelessness, prison time, and early death. While the broader impacts of poverty worsen the risk, no segment of society is immune. Resilience, however, also chronicles the dawn of a movement that is determined to fight back. Trailblazers in pediatrics, education, and social welfare are using cutting-edge science and field-tested therapies to protect children from the insidious effects of toxic stress—and the dark legacy of a childhood that no child would choose.","0","00:02:11",Entertainment,{},NA,youtube,NA,Resilience and stress_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49YZ2rn5R2M,Emotional exhaustion

WHAT IS BURNOUT:
Burnout is what happens when you try to avoid being a human for too long. Burnout is a state of emotional, physical and mental exhaustion cause by excessive and prolonged stress.

The term burnout was originally coined by nasa to describe a rocket which is out of fuel. Gravitational forces mean that i’s still moving but it’s essentially useless.

IS BURNOUT STRESS:
Not really, stress is a high energy state in which everything is go go go. It’s caused by a lack of control so your working harder and harder to meet demand.

Burnout on the other hand is a low energy state, you have ran out of energy to do anything, you’re going through motions and feel demotivated and you may feel your work is meaningless.

SYMPTOMS OF BURNOUT:
Burnout is characterised by 3 main features. Exhaustion and fatigue: the extreme fatigue felt by someone who has been stressed for a very long time. This can present as a complete inability to get out of bed or extreme lethargy. Your get-up-and-go has got-up-and gone! 

Perceived or actual poor performance. People suffering from burnout often feel that their performance is suffering. If the burnout isn’t recognised and treated, perception often becomes a reality.

And Depersonalisation. This characteristically presents as cynicism and lack of empathy. So lets say for example you’re a healthcare professional - This may mean that you begin treating patients as ‘objects’.

These 3 features can lead to the many symptoms and signs of burnout; which include anxiety, insomnia, headaches, other physical illnesses, feelings of lack of purpose, little interest in work and a dread of going to work, among many others.

HOW BAD IS BURNOUT FOR YOUR BODY:
In burnout, the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis which releases cortisol is put into turmoil. Cortisol is one of the stress hormones released when we perceive a threat for example  an imminent attack by a bear, or perhaps a complaint about you

Now In a normally-functioning HPA axis, once the threat has gone, the cortisol drops off and returns to normal. However, under prolonged stress, we operate under increasing levels of cortisol which never return to normal. 

The body responds by eventually down regulating cortisol production to abnormally low levels, and we may experience a state of hypocortisolism, where we have literally burned out our stress–response system. 

And As we know from our endocrine patients, hypocortisolism produces low-grade inflammation which brings many health problems, including coronary heart disease.

BURNOUT TEST:
If you find yourself exhausted, regularly dreading going to work and think that your performance is suffering so any of the symptoms we discussed then alarm bells should start to go off. Here's an online burnout test you can do: https://questionnaires.bma.org.uk/burnout-questionnaire/?OpenForm

BULDING RESILIANCE:
Reset your life and build resilience, resilience is the process of adapting well in face of adversity, it means bouncing back from difficult experiences. This is something that is unique to you and I would strongly recommend that you read the following article for more advice: https://www.independentnurse.co.uk/professional-article/cultivating-resilience-as-a-nurse/215034/

1:40 Causes of Reactive attachment disorder
2:39 Symptoms of Reactive attachment disorder
3:23 Diagnosis of Reactive attachment disorder
4:16 Treatment of Reactive attachment disorder



Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is described in clinical literature as a severe and relatively uncommon disorder that can affect children.[1][2] RAD is characterized by markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate ways of relating socially in most contexts. It can take the form of a persistent failure to initiate or respond to most social interactions in a developmentally appropriate way—known as the ""inhibited form"". In the DSM-5, the ""disinhibited form"" is considered a separate diagnosis named ""disinhibited attachment disorder"".

RAD arises from a failure to form normal attachments to primary caregivers in early childhood. Such a failure could result from severe early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between the ages of six months and three years, frequent changes of caregivers, or a lack of caregiver responsiveness to a child's communicative efforts. Not all, or even a majority of such experiences, result in the disorder.[3] It is differentiated from pervasive developmental disorder or developmental delay and from possibly comorbid conditions such as intellectual disability, all of which can affect attachment behavior. The criteria for a diagnosis of a reactive attachment disorder are very different from the criteria used in assessment or categorization of attachment styles such as insecure or disorganized attachment.

Children with RAD are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal working models of relationships that may lead to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and there is a lack of clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years.[4][5] However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late 1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.[6]","0","00:05:12",People & Blogs,"{""reactive attachment disorder"",""reactive attachment disorder in adulthood"",""reactive attachment disorder documentary"",""reactive attachment disorder in teenager"",""reactive attachment disorder treatment"",""reactive attachment disorder wretched"",""reactive attachment disorder adoption"",""reactive attachment disorder vs disinhibited social engagement disorder"",""reactive attachment disorder interview"",""reactive attachment disorder case"",""reactive attachment disorder foster care""}",NA,youtube,NA,Interpersonal detachment_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kOMCayoSyc,Depersonalization

While the number of physicians and other healthcare providers experiencing burnout were high prior to Covid-19, the pandemic has brought numerous added burdens to the physician workforce, by adding increased stress and responsibility to the workplace.

Can mindfulness help physicians reduce or avoid symptoms of workplace burnout?

Mindfulness cannot change the course of the pandemic, the nursing shortage, and all the uncertainty of this time, but it can help physicians experiencing burnout build their capacity to weather all of these difficulties, and more.

What is the definition of workplace burnout and how can burnout be avoided?

In this Stanford University talk, Dr. Gazelle integrates neuroscience data, clinical studies, and a dynamic case, to help the audience establish a deeper understanding of workplace burnout, develop practical tools, strategies, and skills that they can apply immediately upon leaving the session to enhance their ability to understand, reduce and avoid physician burnout.

As we all know, stress is an inevitable part of life. However, it is important to understand where your stress is coming from and how to manage it in healthy ways. 

First and foremost, let's identify the sources of stress. Stress could come from work, school, relationships, financial problems, health issues, and many more. It is important to understand what triggers your stress and the impact of it on your daily life. For instance, if work is the primary source of your stress, you may notice that you are taking longer days, having trouble sleeping, and your overall energy level is low. By identifying the sources of your stress, you can start to make necessary changes to reduce stress and improve your mental and physical well-being.

Next, it's important to identify unhealthy coping strategies. Many people use unhealthy coping methods such as substance abuse, overeating, binge-watching television, or any other activities that may provide temporary relief but ultimately cause more stress, anxiety, and negative impacts. As someone who has battled with anxiety, I have had my fair share of unhealthy coping strategies. It’s important to acknowledge these behaviors and find healthy alternatives that work best for you.

Lastly, let's discuss healthy coping strategies. There are so many ways to manage stress in a healthy way. Here are some of my favorites:
1. Exercise: Whether it's a quick 15-minute walk or a full-blown workout, physical activity can help alleviate stress and clear your mind.
2. Mindfulness and meditation: Practicing mindfulness can help you stay present in the moment and reduce anxiety. Take a few minutes each day to meditate or practice deep breathing.
3. Connecting with others: Reach out to friends and family and spend time with them. Social support can greatly improve your well-being.
4. Self-care: Take care of yourself by taking a relaxing bath, reading, spending time in nature or doing anything else that rejuvenates your soul. 

In conclusion, identifying sources of stress and understanding healthy coping strategies are crucial for mental and physical health. We all experience stress, but it's how we manage it that truly matters. Leave a comment below and let me know some of your favorite healthy coping strategies.

David Sinclair is a professor in the Department of Genetics and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School, where he and his colleagues study sirtuins—protein-modifying enzymes that respond to changing NAD+ levels and to caloric restriction—as well as chromatin, energy metabolism, mitochondria, learning and memory, neurodegeneration, cancer, and cellular reprogramming.  

Dr David Sinclair has suggested that aging is a disease—and that we may soon have the tools to put it into remission—and he has called for greater international attention to the social, economic and political and benefits of a world in which billions of people can live much longer and much healthier lives. 

Dr David Sinclair is the co-founder of several biotechnology companies (Life Biosciences, Sirtris, Genocea, Cohbar, MetroBiotech, ArcBio, Liberty Biosecurity) and is on the boards of several others. 
He is also co-founder and co-chief editor of the journal Aging. He is an inventor on 35 patents and has received more than 35 awards and honors. In 2014, he was on Time Magazine’s list of the “100 Most Influential People in the World,” and listed as Time's Top 50 in healthcare in 2018.

There will be periods when you have lots of time and energy for your job and times when you struggle to hang on. How should you manage these variations? 

You can have a very successful career without always working flat out. Some types of work build this in, with natural crunch periods. Accountants have the quarterly and year-end closings, as well as tax season. Many retailers have a fourth-quarter push. Video game development is famous for crunch time. All college students recognize midterms and finals week as a type of crunch, and “spring break” as a literal break.

On a more personal level, how can you anticipate some of these periods to best manage them? What can you do when you suddenly find yourself burnt out or forced to take an unexpected pause? What about when things are going your way? How can managers pace their team's crunch time? How can ""A career is a marathon and not a sprint"" be interpreted in your own professional trajectory?

It's a common problem in the workforce and can have serious repercussions on your overall well-being.  Identifying the causes of burnout can help you take steps to address it. Common causes of burnout include overwork, lack of job satisfaction and control, poor workplace relationships, inefficient processes and procedures, high workloads, lack of recognition for achievements, unrealistic expectations from others or yourself, and inadequate resources.

Even if you do hire someone right out of a technical school, there’s no guarantee that they will be high performers or have enough basic knowledge to do anything of use on the shop floor right away.

With that being said, the shortage of new talent should make shop owners think about incentives to retain employees. An employee-retention program centered on recognition is one of the simplest - and most effective - things shop owners can do to boost morale and motivate employees.

In this Tire Review Continental Tire Garage Studio video, let’s explore the importance of recognizing employee milestones to maintain retention.

Ultimately, happiness and job satisfaction are strongly correlated with productivity. You extract the highest-quality, most consistent work from people who are in a good place in terms of their physical wellbeing and mental health, and who feel that their needs are being met.

Employee burnout is the culmination of physical and emotional exhaustion, which can be further impacted by a lack of support and resources.

*  Check in with employees regularly, in one-on-one meetings, to see how they’re doing with their workloads, and to provide help and guidance.

*  Conduct company surveys, exit interviews and even stay interviews to see if your company’s culture normalizes overworking. How do they feel about how much they work? What support do they need?

*  Enable employees to work at home or work flexible hours. Not commuting to the office can make a huge difference when people are feeling overwhelmed.

*  Cut out meetings that are ineffective and without clear goals.

*  Emphasize efficiency as a critical part of your company’s culture, train your staff on what efficiency means in your organization and help them eliminate inefficiencies.

*  Empower your employees to say no — whether it’s to an extra project or a client visit that could be handled just as easily with a phone call.

*  Provide lunch or snacks to employees who work overtime. (For employees entitled to overtime pay, be sure to capture, and pay for, all time worked, including lunches if worked. Follow all Fair Labor Standards Act regulations.)

*  Send out regular salary surveys to see how your organization stacks up. If you’re underpaying your employees, it’s going to lead to burnout faster, and they’re more likely to leave if overworked.

*  Make sure your staff uses their PTO/sick days and takes time off after busy seasons (such as tax season for accounting firms).

*  Encourage work-life balance. Incorporate more flexible scheduling if your business allows for it. You could also give people periodic wellness days – or even a few hours off here and there – so they can recharge or attend to personal matters.

*  Get away from the office periodically to give people a change of scenery and the opportunity to disconnect from office goings-on. For example, take your team out to lunch or have some meetings off-site.","0","00:01:50",People & Blogs,{},NA,youtube,NA,Job satisfaction and burnout_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tJSlVaRYSI,Depersonalization

This is part 6 of The Emotional Intelligence Series. 
You can check out the first video here: https://youtu.be/IFTgPq3068Y

Empathy is crucial because it helps us understand how others are feeling so we can respond appropriately to the situation. It is typically associated with social behaviour, and there is lots of research showing that greater empathy leads to more helping behaviour.

It makes us better leaders, friends, co-workers, and well-liked. We all want to feel connected to one another, no matter what. By showing empathy is the best way to gain a better understanding not only about other people and your surroundings but with yourself. 

『 The Emotional Intelligence Series 』

When referring to Emotional Intelligence, we don't often have the break down of the critical components. Hence, why this series is created!

 My goal is to spread self, and social awareness to a world that's distorted with mass media telling us how we should act and what success looks like, which leaves a number of us lost, depressed and anxious.

For mental fatigue both aerobic and anaerobic activity could be prescribed for patients. It would be suggested to the patient to do 10 minutes a day, most days of the week (3-5 days a week) in order to see a change in the mental fatigue. However, Dr Mustian highlights that the prescription would be different for physical fatigue. The data and evidence suggest that patients need to do 20-30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic and anaerobic activity a day in order for them to reduce physical fatigue. Dr Mustian states that exercise is one of the most important things that can be offered to patients in terms of supportive care. In a cancer arena, exercise should be part of a standard of care, as the evidence shows benefits in cases of fatigue, depression, physical function, cachexia, sarcopenia, infections, nausea, vomiting, and others.

Here are some strategies that can help you achieve greater satisfaction and fulfillment in your professional life:


Define your values and align them with your work: Identify your core values and ensure that your job aligns with them. When your work is in harmony with your values, you'll feel more fulfilled and motivated.


Set meaningful goals: Establish clear and achievable goals that excite you. Having a sense of purpose and direction will provide a sense of fulfillment as you work towards them.


Cultivate positive relationships: Build positive relationships with your colleagues, superiors, and subordinates. A supportive and collaborative work environment enhances job satisfaction and happiness.


Seek opportunities for growth and development: Look for ways to expand your skills and knowledge within your current role or through professional development opportunities. Continuous learning and personal growth contribute to a more fulfilling career.


Practice work-life balance: Maintain a healthy balance between your personal and professional life. Prioritize self-care, set boundaries, and make time for activities and relationships outside of work. A balanced lifestyle enhances overall well-being and job satisfaction.


Find purpose in your work: Understand how your role contributes to the larger purpose of your organization. Recognize the impact of your work and how it positively affects others. Feeling that your work matters can bring greater fulfillment.


Seek autonomy and challenge: Strive for a balance of autonomy and challenges in your work. Autonomy allows you to take ownership of your tasks, while challenges provide opportunities for growth and learning.


Celebrate accomplishments: Recognize and celebrate your achievements and milestones. Acknowledging your successes, no matter how small, boosts motivation and satisfaction.


Foster a positive mindset: Cultivate a positive attitude towards your work. Focus on the aspects you enjoy, reframe challenges as opportunities, and practice gratitude for the positive aspects of your job.


Regularly reassess your career path: Periodically evaluate whether your current career path is still aligned with your goals and values. If necessary, be open to exploring new opportunities or making changes to ensure long-term fulfillment.


Remember, everyone's definition of a fulfilling career may vary. It's important to reflect on your own needs and desires and make choices that align with your personal vision of happiness and success.","0","00:00:53",People & Blogs,{},NA,youtube,NA,Building career fulfillment_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70wrBhnntFA,Personal achievement

Job satisfaction tips,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=753cKQoBBnA,"5 Tips to Improve Patient Satisfaction",Etactics,"1","978","15",0,"0","How many of you leave the doctor’s office thinking that you had a totally pleasant experience?

This probably isn’t the case for many of us since most people don’t enjoy going to the doctor. But as a doctor, the impression that you leave on your patients either helps or harms your practice. If patients have a great experience, then they’ll likely return.

They might even brag about how awesome you were to the people they know, which helps get you new patients. But if people have an unpleasant visit, they’ll switch practices and share their dissatisfaction with others. In the end, you’ll end up losing patients and revenue if you don’t offer the best customer satisfaction. So how do you make sure their experience is exceptional?

LINKS:
 ____________________________________________

https://etactics.com/blog/how-to-improve-patient-satisfaction
____________________________________________

The first tip is to improve communication. Doctors should use the 50/70 rule for eye contact when with patients. This means maintaining eye contact for 50% of the time when speaking and 70% of the time when listening. This helps the patient know that you’re actually paying attention to the conversation. Don’t interrupt them either. On average, patients only have 11 seconds to explain the reason for their visit before the doctor interrupts.

This would make them feel like you aren’t taking their concern seriously. You should also use basic language that they can understand. 30% of English speaking patients don’t understand simple medical terms. This could make it difficult for them to follow a treatment plan if they don’t know what it means. So confirm with them that they understand their diagnosis and treatment, and clarify anything if needed. 

Second, help the patient know what to expect from their visit. Only 3% of people actually fear going to the doctor while a majority just fear the unknown. In 2018, 34% of Americans had confidence in medical leaders compared to 75% in 1966. To help them trust your expertise, show your professional knowledge to prove credibility. 

This should go without saying, but you should also always put the patient first. However, 24% of American patients don’t feel valued by their healthcare provider. There are a few steps you can take to change this, though. For example, focus on patient outcomes since the health industry is moving toward value-based care. Also make emotional connections with patients to show that you care about them and their well-being. And third, say thank you. You wouldn’t be in business without them, so show that you appreciate them.

The fourth tip is to improve patient wait times. One of the most frustrating parts of a doctor visit is spending more time waiting than actually with the doctor. Hospital ratings decrease as the wait times increase. The average appointment wait time is over 18 minutes. Only 33% of physicians spend 17-24 minutes with their patients. This means people often spend more time waiting than with their doctor. Sometimes you can’t control these long wait times, but you can at least let clients know how long they can expect to wait. 88% of patients said that knowing in advance how long they’d be waiting helps reduce the frustration. 

Finally, a simple way to improve satisfaction is to ask for feedback. While the tips I just gave you can help, no one knows how to improve your practice better than your own clients. Using satisfaction surveys will show your patients that you actually care about them and their concerns. It gives insights on other ways you can improve their experience and quality of care.

Some clients might have complaints regardless of what you do to make their experience better. No matter how hard you try, you just can’t please everyone. But you can cater to a majority of your patients by implementing these steps. And overall, this will improve retention and boost revenue.

About Me:
I’m Emma McAdam. I’m a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, and I have worked in various settings of change and growth since 2004. My experience includes juvenile corrections, adventure therapy programs, wilderness therapy programs, an eating disorder treatment center, a residential treatment center, and I currently work in an outpatient therapy clinic.  

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction.

Enhancing motivation at work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hPh5k8Xeeg,"7 Methods to Motivate Your Team - See Motivation Improve Quickly",Enhance.training,unknown,"6766","144",0,"6","7 methods to motivate your team gives you practical actionable methods to motivate a team which work with all teams.

Knowing how to motivate a team is a great skill for any manager to have and everyone can learn how to motivate. Engaged and motivated teams perform a lot better and are much nicer places to work – great for everyone.

So the first method to motivate a team is to share your vision with your team. Explain the direction and goals you want to achieve. Explain how this fits in with the company goals and why each team member has an important role to play. 

The second way to motivate your team is to understand the goals of each team member. Everyone is different and have different hopes and dreams. Take each person through how achieving the company and team goals can also help the individual achieve some of their goals. 

Leading by example is another way for motivating your team at work. I always found it very motivational being in a team with a hardworking successful manager who lives by the same rules they set for everyone. Leading by example is great for how to motivate and inspire employees.


How to motivate team members as a leader includes actively developing team members. There are so many ways to develop team members without needing a large budget. Plan out what you can do to move each person in your team forward and keep them learning.

When thinking to ways to motivate your team, praising regularly should feature highly. We all want praise for work well done and as a manager, look for opportunities to praise employees. Positive reinforcement really does work. 

The sixth method to motivate a team is to proactively remove blockers. Having to fight against blockers is painful and demotivating. Look at your processes. Deal with conflict and underperformers. Deal with disruptive staff. Take action.

Seventh, for how to motivate employees – practice a positive management style. There are many behaviours and actions that go into a positive management style – some we have covered already. Additional ones include promoting open communication, being consistent and spending time listening to your team members. These are all great actions to motivate your team

Put into practice at least one of the methods outlined in “7 methods to Motivate your team”. Once you have this up and running, put into action the next one. It won’t be long before you have them all running, and you will quickly see the impact on team motivation.

Enjoy working with a more motivated team!

Studies confirm that caregivers play host to a high level of compassion fatigue. 

In this insightful talk, Patricia Smith suggests the path to wellness begins with awareness, and recommends simple self-care measures such as regular exercise, healthy eating habits, enjoyable social activities, journaling, and restful sleep.  With support, insightful information, and authentic self-care, caregivers can begin to understand the complexity of the emotions they've been juggling and, most likely, suppressing.

As founder of the Compassion Fatigue Awareness Project© (www.compassionfatigue.org), Patricia Smith writes, speaks and facilities trainings nationwide in service of those who care for others. With a background in journalism, she has authored books and training materials including the award-winning To Weep for a Stranger: Compassion Fatigue in Caregiving.

Emotional fatigue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S33spUGaE0,I am So Emotionally Drained,Kati Morton,unknown,"79989","7003",0,"1562","I was listening to a podcast the other day and someone mentioned being emotionally drained, and it hit me, that’s what I am feeling. It’s not just being burned out, it’s emotionally taxing and I don’t have anymore to give. Which has been hard. I have been more irritable, not as patient with Sean or other people in my life, and am often agitated by an ask I received in my email. I hate feeling this way, it’s uncomfortable, and out of character for me. So I wanted to share it, in case it’s helpful to any of you. Because this is a shitty shitty time. I still find myself wanting to cry frequently, I feel bad that I feel bad because other people have it worse, and I even worry about mentioning any of that because I have that self judgement telling me that I should be over it by now. But how the fuck are we supposed to be over something that’s still going on, when nothing has really changed and cities and countries are going in and out of lock down, and there’s still no treatment or vaccine.

Presented by Lillee Smith Gelinas, MSN, RN, CPPS, FAAN, Nurse Executive and Senior Fellow, SaferCare Texas, University of North Texas Health Science Center

This webinar series is co-sponsored by SaferCare Texas (formerly known as the UNTHSC Institute for Patient Safety).

Description: Recent research published by the National Academy of Medicine links poor healthcare outcomes to clinician burnout, including lower quality, increased costs, higher turnover and alarming rates of suicide and depression.  Evidence-based strategies to address the problem are known, but less clear is how organizations can successfully implement them. 
 
The issues related to this hidden epidemic will be described and how the ability to achieve optimal performance and outcome excellence is undermined by worker fatigue and burnout.  The importance of worker overall health and well-being to create and sustain a culture of safety, a healthy work environment, and a work-life balance will be presented. 
 
Objectives:
-Discuss recent research linking burnout to poor personal and organizational performance
-Identify promising approaches and current strategies to address fatigue and burnout
-Understand how to recognize risks in co-workers and team members
-Describe resources available for personal and organizational well-being

Dr. Balcetis’ research focuses on how our perception of the world, particularly our visual perceptions, influences our level and persistence of motivation, how we conceptualize goals, actual goal achievement, and our emotional state as we pursue goals. Dr. Balcetis explains how to best visualize and overcome challenges in pursuit of larger, complex goals. We also discuss the science of how to define goals and intermediate milestones, overcome obstacles, and effectively track progress. This episode highlights science-based, immediately actionable tools that anyone can use to set and achieve physical and/or cognitive goals more effectively.

TRANSCRIPT: Our relations with [Adam Michnik] became complicated after a while. These complications had begun over the telephone when I was fulfilling a significant role which he, of course, acknowledged and knew because he was one of the closest contacts with 'Aneks' and a source of information. I’ve already mentioned how when he was staying with Fr Jankowski in his presbytery during the strike, he heard one of my analyses which was broadcast by the BBC or maybe Radio Free Europe and he was furious because it was a purely analytical, detached comparison with similar movements in other European countries so, in other words, without any emotional engagement. That’s when he said what I’ve already mentioned here that I was regarding them with the gaze of an ichthyologist which wasn’t true – I was very engaged with the events. However, then as now, when I’m preparing an analysis, I try to maintain a certain detachment. To this day there is conflict on account of that.","0","00:01:08",News & Politics,"{""Aleksander Smolar"",""Web of Stories"",politics,Solidarność,""Stefan Batory Foundation"",""political activist"",Poland,""Adam Michnik""}",NA,youtube,NA,Professional detachment_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=810556ZU10w,Depersonalization

FURTHER READING

“Being someone who pleases people sounds, on the face of it, like a very good idea. But it is a pattern of behaviour riddled with problems, as much for the perpetrator as for their audience; the people-pleaser is someone (who might at times be oneself) who feels they have no option but to mould themselves to the expectations of others, and yet, harbours all manner of secret and at points dangerous reservations and resentments. They act like the perfect lover when their real feelings are far darker; they give their assent to plans they hate; and they confuse everyone around them by failing to express, in due time, with the requisite courage, their authentic needs and ambitions...”

Here's a sketch video about self-assessment and peer assessment. It includes an explanation of specific strategies you might use. 

Transcript:

Assessment is all around us. If you’re a skater at a skatepark, you’re engaging in self-assessment every time you reflect on your progress and plan next steps. 

If you’re a runner training for a marathon, you look at time splits and compare it to your goals. If you’re a musician, you’re engaging in assessment every time you listen to yourself play 
and make modifications on your approach. 

As an author, you engage in self-assessment when you revise your work. It’s not always individual. Often, assessment happens in community. If you’re a chef, you’re engaging in peer assessment when you ask a trusted fellow chef, “how does this taste?” 

If you’re an artist you might ask for an extra set of eyes on a particular project. If you’re an engineer, you might observe users to see if your design is working. If you do any kind of creative work, both self-assessment and peer assessment are vital for improving your craft. 

It helps you refine your process and helps you improve your products. 
Assessment helps us figure how what we know, what we don’t know, and what steps we need to take in the future to master a skill or understand a concept at a deeper level. 

But what does this mean in the classroom? 

It starts with self-assessment. Here students engage in goal-setting: where they set goals, plan their approach, and keep track of the progress. They also engage in self-reflections. Here, they can reflect on their learning process but also focus on the strengths and weaknesses of their products, which then leads to new iterations.  

A similar option is a student survey with multiple choices, checkboxes, and Likert scales. In some cases, students might use a self-assessment rubric. Students are able to look at the progression from emerging to mastering with specific descriptions in various categories. They are able to gain an accurate view of how they are doing, while also having a clear picture of where they need to be. 

Students might also use checklists. These can be a powerful diagnostic tool that students use before, during, and after a task. When projects are done, they can present their work in a portfolio, where they reflect on what they’ve learned. 

Peer assessment is also important. One option is the 10-minute peer feedback system. This begins with one student sharing their work or pitching an idea while the other student actively listens.

It then moves into a chance to ask clarifying questions, get feedback, respond to feedback, and chart out next steps. Another option is structured Feedback with Sentence Stems. Or you could use the 3-2-1 Structure. This is simple. Students provide three strengths, two areas of improvement and one question that they have. 

Or you could do a feedback carousel. Each group gets a stack of sticky notes and offers anonymous feedback as they move from group to group. Or you could keep it more open-ended with Peer Coaching: Students interview each other about the process, guide reflection, and provide feedback. 

We often think of classroom assessment as a conversation between teachers and students. But in life, students won’t always have a teacher to grade their work or provide them with necessary feedback. This is why we need self-assessment and peer assessment. The more we can integrate this into our lessons, the better prepared our students will be for the creative life.","0","00:03:53",Education,"{education,creativity,classrooms,teachers,assessment,self-assessment,""peer assessment""}",NA,youtube,NA,Empowerment self at work_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WxvVgXC_NY,Personal achievement

#getup #makeithappen #motivationalspeech #disciplinedthinking 
Rise up from your slumber, oh radiant soul,
Embrace the world with a spirit untold.
In the depths of your being, a fire burns bright,
Igniting your dreams, illuminating your night.

With each dawn that breaks, a new chance is born,
To conquer the doubts, to weather the storm.
Summon your courage, let it guide your way,
For within you, lies the power to seize the day.

Awaken your spirit, let passion ignite,
The dreams that lay dormant, now take flight.
Doubt and fear, they have no hold,
When determination and purpose unfold.

Stand tall, my friend, and face the unknown,
With resilience and strength, your true essence shown.
Cast aside the shackles that hold you back,
Break free from the chains, and leave no track.

Embrace the challenge, the path less trodden,
For greatness awaits those who dare to be bolden.
In the realm of possibilities, your dreams await,
So rise up, dear soul, it's time to create.

The world is your canvas, let your heart be the brush,
Paint a masterpiece with every step, every hush.
Make it happen, oh radiant being,
The universe cheers, your triumph it is seeing.

So rise, my friend, and make your mark,
In this dance of life, let your light embark.
For within you lies the power, the divine,
To manifest your dreams, make them truly shine.

Get up and make it happen, with unwavering might,
Let your purpose guide you, through day and night.
Believe in yourself, for you hold the key,
To unlock the potential, and set your spirit free.

Additionally, this presentation will provide ideas and practical exercises that blend psycho-education with Christian contemplative practices for rest and renewal. These tools can be used personally, as part of staff retreats, or in pastoral-based work settings for spiritual formation.

Trust is necessary for a healthy and efficient work environment.

This trust emerges when not only do we feel safe within our company, but that our leaders genuinely care about us.

Establishing these relationships requires vulnerability and honesty from both leaders and their employees.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIMON O. SINEK

Simon O. Sinek is an author best known for popularizing the concept of ""the golden circle"" and to ""Start With Why,"" described by TED as ""a simple but powerful model for inspirational leadership all starting with a golden circle and the question ""Why?""'. He joined the RAND Corporation in 2010 as an adjunct staff member, where he advises on matters of military innovation and planning. His first TEDx Talk on ""How Great Leaders Inspire Action"" is the 3rd most viewed video on TED.com. His 2009 book on the same subject, Start With Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action (2009) delves into what he says is a naturally occurring pattern, grounded in the biology of human decision-making, that explains why we are inspired by some people, leaders, messages and organizations over others.

He has commented for The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Houston Chronicle, FastCompany, CMO Magazine, NPR, and BusinessWeek, and is a regular contributor to The Huffington Post, BrandWeek, and IncBizNet.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transcript: When we talk about a trusting team or trusting partners I think very often we forget that trust is not an instruction. Trust is a feeling. You cannot tell someone to trust you. No leader can just tell their company trust me. It doesn’t work that way. Trust is a feeling. It’s a biological feeling that comes from the environment we’re in. When we feel safe in our own environment, when we feel that our leaders care about us as human beings and want to see us grow and build our confidence in our skills, when we feel safe in our own companies, trust emerges. It’s what happens. When we do not feel save in our own companies, when we feel that our leaders would soon as sacrifice us to save numbers rather than sacrifice numbers to save us the human response to those conditions is cynicism, paranoia, mistrust and self-interest. And so if we want to build trusting teams we have to create environments. Leaders have to set an environment in which the people feel safe amongst themselves and from us.

There’s much discussion about this concept of vulnerability at work. We have to be vulnerable we’re told. That doesn’t mean walking around crying. What vulnerability means is saying things like I don’t know what I’m doing. It means like you put me in a job and I don’t know how to do that job. It means raising your hand and saying I made a mistake. These put us in a vulnerable position, especially in a work world in which layoffs are used so casually that I feel like I’m on a short list. And so we would rather not express any sense of weakness whether it’s fear or doubt or mistakes that we’ve made or lack of skills. We just keep it to ourselves and too many of us spend our days lying, hiding and faking. The irony is our attempt to present ourselves as strong every day means the company itself will get weak. Because if no one is admitting mistakes, those mistakes will compound. If people are doing jobs that they don’t know how to do and they’re lying, hiding and faking that means the output will be weak. The irony is is when people hide their fallibility, their humanity it actually makes the company weak. But when we create environments in which people feel safe enough to say to their boss I need help or I don’t know what I’m doing or I made a mistake. The amazing thing is that actually makes the organization stronger.

So the question is how do we if we do not work in an environment that offers us that safe circle that we can express ourselves thusly then the question is what are we supposed to do? Well it’s kind of like any human relationship. You don’t start on the first date telling them all of your fears and anxieties and insecurities. That would be madness, right. You get to know somebody first. And then as you get to know them you take a little risk and you share something small. And you see if they listen and they make you feel understood and they make you feel heard. Or if they make you feel stupid or small. And if it feels safe you take another little risk and another little risk and they take a risk. If you’re the only one doing it it doesn’t work either.

Either face it or run away from it, but running away will not help you in any way, which is why we need to discuss self-efficacy. 
At some point all of us have felt our confidence waver or worried we couldn’t overcome a problem we faced.
But there is nothing to worry about if you lack self-efficacy because the truth is it is a psychological skill you too can improve with just a few steps. In this video we will show you how!

While self-care helps you manage your stress it does not solve the structural inequalities that create the conditions that cause burnout. We need to use behavior change science to create individual, organizational and cultural change to prevent burnout.

 Dr Jacqueline Kerr is a mom, behavior scientist and burnout survivor. She is in the Top 1% of Most Cited Scientists worldwide and her work has informed the US Center for Disease Control Community Prevention Guide. Dr. Kerr left her position as a public health professor in 2018. She now hosts the Podcast 'Overcoming Working Mom Burnout' where she interviews researchers, diversity experts, and leadership coaches, focusing on #mentalillness . She is on a mission to dismantle the causes of working mom burnout and #genderbias with individual, organizational and cultural change through behavior change science.

Goal Setting is not difficult if it is done properly.  So watch this video if you want to set and achieve your most precious goals. 

The problem is everyone wants life to be greater but almost all of us get stuck at times or something prevents us from doing what we really are capable of doing whether shifting a relationship, turning around our finances, getting in proper shape. Instead of being happy, we get stuck with the belief of how we are not supposed to be, what we are not supposed to do, what we are not capable of. We are stuck in the emotional pattern of being pissed off or being frustrated. Sometimes we are stuck in our habits of doing things in certain ways and that is because we lack proper planning and proper motivation to achieve our goals. 

So the first step to achieve your goals is knowing yourself. 
Step 2 is to set your goals. 
Step 3 is to create short term goals
Step 4 is to be consistent.

Cook spoke as part of his class reunion at the school.(www.fuqua.duke.edu)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

APPLE CEO AND FUQUA ALUM TIM COOK TALKS LEADERSHIP AT DUKE

Tim Cook spoke to students and alums when he returned for his 25th reunion



""Explore everything. Push the corners of your mind. Just get on this kind of continual learning roller coaster and see what happens.""

This was among the advice Apple CEO Tim Cook shared with students at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business on April 26th. Back on campus for his 25-year reunion, Cook took part in an hour-long dialogue with Fuqua Dean Bill Boulding and the students in a jam-packed Geneen Auditorium buzzing with excitement to hear from the leader of the world's most profitable company.

The Apple CEO has embarked on a career far different than he had envisioned after graduating from Fuqua's Evening Executive MBA program in 1988. ""For me the journey was not predictable at all. You have to find your own north star and stay with your north star.""

As 450 Daytime MBA students prepared to graduate, Cook advised the students to heed Abraham Lincoln's words of wisdom: ""I will prepare and someday my chance will come.""

Cook shared the three keys to his leadership at Apple: people, strategy, and execution. ""If you get those three right the world is a great place.""

Students were able to get a unique glimpse into Cook's motivation, inspiration and leadership role models. Raised in the south and a witness to racial injustice, Cook described his admiration for Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Junior's bravery in risking their lives to fight for what they believed in. He has just three photos in his office: two of Kennedy and one of King.

Cook was asked when to follow strict principles of business theory and when to break the rules. His response stressed the importance of risks and learning from failure. ""You should rarely follow the rules. What Fuqua teaches you so well is how to learn and how to collaborate. Write your own rules.""

This message resonated with first-year MBA student Shelby Hall. ""I know this follows Steve Jobs' belief that Apple creates products which consumers didn't ever know existed,"" she said. ""It was interesting to hear Tim Cook's perspective on how we should balance writing our own rules while applying the foundations of business taught here at Fuqua.""

Cook also spoke about some of his recollections from Fuqua. ""The people made it an incredible experience. It was great for me to see how bright people approached solutions in different ways.""

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

Resilience building,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abB-bQc_aXk,What is Resilience and How Do I Improve it? | Kati Morton,Kati Morton,unknown,"104072","5442",0,"327","Resiliency is defined as “the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties or toughness” but when it comes to our psychological health it’s a bit more than that. It’s about our ability to manage any crisis or upset and get back to baseline quickly, meaning that life’s ups and downs don’t throw us off for that long, we have tools and resources and we can bounce back quickly.
I have often used the poker chip analogy to describe resilience, if you don’t know what I’m talking about, I have shared in other videos how we wake up with a certain number of poker chips, and stressful or difficult things cost us some of those chips. Others prefer the spoons analogy, but either way we are talking about resilience.
And I know you are wondering how we know what our resiliency is or how good or bad we are doing with it, and the way to find that out is to notice, or even think back to the last crisis we had and think about how long it took you to get back to feeling like yourself. Was it a quick turn around? Or did we struggle for weeks, months, or even years? If we bounce back easily, we have more resilience, and if we struggle to move past it, we have less. But no matter how much resilience we have we can all benefit from more of it...

Transcript:

Your baby is all smiles this month, and chances are, you will be too. Welcome to month four, the beginning of what most seasoned parents would describe as the golden age of babyhood: several months, or even more, of pure baby bliss. Bye bye, baby blob stage. See you later, screaming sessions. Hello bundle of expansive, responsive baby joy, smiles for miles, delight for days, personality plus, plus, plus. 
And here's another plus: your newly social butterfly is still not independently mobile, which means she'll mostly stay where you put her, and as long as she has your attention, she's likely more than happy to do so. And as if that's not enough yummy to melt you into a pool of lovestruck slush, just wait until you hear the world's most delicious sound: your baby squealing, and even giggling. And it won't take much silliness to get that glee going, either. 
Baby's an easy audience, and an eager performer. No more awkward face plants. Your baby will most likely be able to lift his head 90 degrees when he's on his belly, thanks to all that tummy time practice you've given him. 
Other amazing milestones to look for, your baby will anticipate being lifted when you reach to pick her up, and she'll practically jump for joy as you do. She'll also likely be able to turn in the direction of a sound, like the sound of your very familiar voice, and soon, if she hasn't already, be able to roll over at least one way. Belly to back typically comes first. Watch your wriggler closely, so she doesn't roll into trouble. 
You can help encourage these and other fantastic physical feats by continuing to offer plenty of supervised tummy time, but don't stop there. At playtime, get your baby moving by raising his hands up and down over his head, and back to that roly-poly belly. Add some activity into those endless diaper changes, too, by bicycling those dimply legs in a rhythmic way. 
Adding to the joy, a new love of toys. Play gyms and activity mats, of course, but also sensory toys that trill or squeak or tweet or rattle when pressed or shaken. High on the fan favorite list are toys that play music, especially in reaction to your baby's movements, and because your little one is reaching for toys now, she'll especially adore any playthings she can grasp onto and shake. 
Also this month is some welcome news for sleep-deprived parents. Some babies, but certainly not all, are able to sleep longer stretches at night. Think six to eight hours at a time. There's a really wide range of normal, but you can hopefully expect your sweet snoozer to take anywhere from two to four daytime naps, each lasting anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours. Baby's total sleep per 24-hour day, around 14 to 16 hours, still leaving plenty of time to play the day away. Here's to a happy fourth month.","0","00:03:53",Education,{},NA,youtube,NA,Recognizing achievements and milestones_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdIM7eAVPtU,Personal achievement

In this guided meditation, Deepak Chopra leads us towards self-empowerment through choice. When you open your mind to your ability to make different choices in any moment, you begin to realize the expansive freedom and hope that exists around you. Being aware of the cause and effect aspects of our life brings additional awareness of Karma, one of the spiritual laws of the universe. 

This empowerment meditation includes repetition of the mantra ""I am a powerful creator."" By this, we are meant to see the ways in which we have the ability to manifest our own futures, and create the lives we want to live.

And that's not all. If you listen to my idea, you will intake the KBs and convert them into pictures, more concepts, connect with you memories, experiences and learnings. And this again becomes GBs of data. Interesting right? 

It shows you how communication is not a simple thing and requires skill for this GB-to-KB-to-GB conversion to happen as we intend i.e for a good communication to happen. Also shows you how we should select our words carefully when we speak or write and pay a lot of attention when we listen or read","0","00:10:21",People & Blogs,{},NA,youtube,NA,Improving communication skills_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aErhdW7ouaM,Depersonalization

Coping skills can be really important for anxiety. They often soothe or comfort us, and they help us calm down and make better choices. However, coping skills do nothing to solve our problems in the long term, and some of them, if used exclusively, can be harmful. Coping skills help us take a break from our discomfort, but also from our life purpose. So that’s why I get a little bugged when I hear that the only skill someone is learning in therapy is how to cope. 
Using coping skills to get through a crisis and get calm and then coming back and resolving the problem is the best long-term practice. This ability to pause before choosing an action is an essential skill of emotionally resilient people.

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction. 
And deeper than all of that, the Gospel of Jesus Christ orients my personal worldview and sense of security, peace, hope, and love https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe

But can we really learn to persevere—and even get better at it over time? Mamie Morrow knows we can. Building on her 20 years’ experience as an educator, Morrow shows us how our belief in our own ability to succeed is critical to actually succeeding, and how this belief—known as “self-efficacy”—can in fact be taught once it’s broken down into its constituent parts. The keys to self-efficacy include personally experiencing success with the specific task; observing others like ourselves succeeding in the task; receiving regular encouragement; and learning to reinterpret and thus manage negative feelings, including anxiety and the fear of failure. Mamie Morrow has taught pre-K, elementary, and secondary students in schools around the world. In her work as a Teachstone CLASS specialist, she has led training and coaching programs for teachers, coaches, and administrators across the United States. Morrow earned her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in elementary education from the University of New Mexico. She lives in Jacksonville, Florida with her husband and two daughters.

Lack of empathy at work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOVPwJ7iPG8,What Does A Lack Of Empathy Look Like? | Why Don't Narcissists Have Empathy?,Mindset Therapy PLLC,unknown,"6260","272",0,"34","How can narcissists be so mean and appear to not even care about you or how you feel?  Narcissists lack empathy and they can’t connect to others and their emotional experiences.  What does a lack of empathy look like? Why don’t narcissists have empathy? These are questions I answer in this video. Do narcissists lack empathy? Yes.  A lack of empathy means the person cannot relate to the emotional experiences of others.  They are inward focused and their environment is experienced from their own perspective.  If you are sad or upset, they don’t fully understand why and cannot relate to that experience.  This can also be for positive emotions as well.  If narcissists lack empathy, can a narcissist love someone or do narcissists only love themselves?  People with narcissistic personality disorder, or narcissism for short, lack object constancy in addition do lacking empathy.  While these two things are not directly related, they do influence each other.  If a narcissist is mad, they can no longer view you as someone they loved 5 minutes ago.  Combine that with a lack of empathy and you have someone who is prone to narcissistic injury who forgets they once had positive feelings for you, goes into narcisissitic rage, and then can’t understand why you are upset with their reaction.  Not only do they expect everyone to have an emotion only for that specific moment in time, they also can’t take the perspective of someone who might feel differently.  This is a factor in narcissistic crazy making and why you feel like you are the only one who sees things for how they are, even if the narcissist wants you to think otherwise.  Empathy is what allows us to build connection with others.  Lack of empathy is narcissist is one reason why their relationships are superficial and based solely on what they want.

Workload management,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApStnHfwcG0,How to Manage Your Workload & Priorities | PM Tips for Non-PMs,teamgantt,"12600","844","9",0,"0","In this video, Jason shares quick tips for managing your own workload and priorities and discusses why delivering workload balance is one of the most important things a project manager can do for their team and projects.

Achieving workload balance is really all about managing your priorities. But when you’re the one doing the work, you might not have a clear sense of the project’s big picture. That can make it tough to determine which tasks take first priority when your week is stacked with things to do.

Likewise, your project manager can’t read your mind and might not realize you’re feeling bogged down by too much work. That’s why it’s important to be an active partner in your own workload management. 

Watch this video to see a simple way you can spot task conflicts in your own workload so you can work with your project manager to resolve workload issues before you get overwhelmed.

What  do you do to make sure your workload—or your team’s—is managed appropriately? Let us know in the comments. We’re always on the lookout for new tips and tricks!

Depersonalization and burnout,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av7r20c_OYs,BURNOUT Among Medical Students & Doctors (& What To Do About It) #SHORTS,Med School Insiders,unknown,"14370","1107",0,"9","Doctors and medical students have some of the highest suicide rates of any profession and a common precursor to suicide is burnout. But what is burnout, and how can you avoid it?

Burnout is described as physical or mental collapse caused by overwork or stress. It’s characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment.

Chronic exposure to stress is the main risk factor for burnout and medical professionals regularly experience high levels of stress. Increasing competitiveness and administrative demands such as documentation and billing are other factors that contribute to burnout among physicians.

So how can you reduce the risk of burnout in your own life?

Tip number one is to lean into your social support system. This includes talking to your friends and family, as well as seeking professional help if you start to feel burned out.

Tip number two is get enough sleep. According to research, the more you sleep, the more resilient you are against burnout.

Lastly, tip number three is to optimize your day-to-day life. Making your life more efficient and picking up healthy habits can help decrease burnout.

Milestones should also be pre-meditated events that occur on our way to hitting goals, finishing projects and building our businesses. They provide a frame of reference for how far we've come and what's ahead.

As entrepreneurs, we have no problem finding what's wrong in our business. It's a lot harder to recognize what's great and take time to recognize the people who are doing great things! Developing milestones for your business allows you to celebrate with your team. You can cast a vision and track the progress by rewarding team members for what's accomplished along the way.

Next time you start a project, decide what the milestones will be and how you will celebrate each one. If you're not celebrating achievements with your team, they don't know what they've accomplished and are probably pretty unmotivated. Milestones will give them goals to hit and when they do, you celebrate!","0","00:02:27",People & Blogs,"{""Chris LoCurto"",CLo.TV,""milestones in business"",""setting milestones"",""importance of milestones"",""milestones matter"",""milestones in life and business"",""celebrate milestones"",""milestones and goals"",""small business milestones"",""entrepreneur milestones"",""milestones starting a business"",""Video Lesson""}",NA,youtube,NA,Recognizing achievements and milestones_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYjDvz2urNk,Personal achievement

When we strive to live a healthy life, we think mostly of losing weight, being more active, and eating healthy. While these things will all contribute to our overall wellbeing, they might not deal with some of the issues we prefer to neglect – emotional and mental health.

You might find yourself wondering why these two aspects of being human are so important if no one can really see them. But that’s exactly the point. Because we keep our feelings and emotions hidden from other people, they can become toxic over time, eventually leading to mental health issues like depression, anxiety, or panic attacks. Looking after our wellbeing and trying to live healthier is not just about the physical.

So what’s the difference between mental and emotional health?  Here you will also get to know about depression, anxiety, or panic attacks and tips on improving your emotional health. To know more watch the full video.

Season 2 is back in Minneapolis for a large-scale retrofit of a 111-year-old house: Tightening up the envelope, adding durability to the shell, and dramatically improving the interior conditioning and IAQ

Resilient construction and design come down to building and remodeling houses that can take a punch from the weather, and provide a healthy, comfortable, and sustainable living space for the people and pets who live there.

... and because it's remodeling nothing is ever a straight line. We're going to look at a bunch of different parts and pieces on a couple different projects including this one right behind me.

So this house built in 1910 is a pretty traditional stucco house we see a lot of these bungalows here there's a little bit of that Frank Lloyd Wrighty Asian influence going on, some good overhangs.

It's got some good bones to it, and at 111 years old it is a perfect candidate for a healthy renovation.

Healthy renovations, in the context of resiliency, means designing and building for a changing climate that may include more heat, hurricanes, lightning storms that can cause wildfire, tornadoes, flooding, and ice storms.

Since season 1, we’ve seen first-hand the importance of a healthy home; but also since season 1, the climate zone maps have been updated.

This means that some people now find themselves in a different climate zone than yesterday. Most of the jurisdictions moved to warmer zones, but some moved colder ones.

Minneapolis stayed in the same climate zone, but a few counties to its north moved into the warmer zone 6. 

The extreme weather events and changing climate have prompted some big cities to establish their own resilient design guides. 

So, DC has its new resilient design principles and in them, they look at heat and flooding...

Washington DC developed guidelines with the Resilient Design Institute—our source for last year’s resilient construction gut-checks. 

Local conditions dictate where the best bang for the buck is, and in Washington DC’s case, it is focusing on extreme heat and three sources of flooding.

Minneapolis has a lot of trees so we're pretty good when it comes to heat island effect. The houses are going to stay a little cooler.

And for flooding, well, we're up at the top of a hill and it goes way way down below where you're standing right now, down to a creek so this house isn't going to flood.

Really when it comes to resilient design it starts with site selection. If we have sandy soils and a poured concrete foundation with high elevation then we can go ahead and check off that first box.

The house has a 15-year old addition that was doomed to failure
And while we’re checking off boxes, we’re gonna check around the back of the house to see where the addition is going.

Over here on the side, we've got this really cool sunroom with this kind of unfortunate storm window detail—we're going to get rid of
that we're going to have those windows extend up vertically it's going to look really sharp. 

We've got that nice little shingle-holder up there on the roof.

And then over here where the newer addition was put on the house and there's some issues with how it was built.

We'll take a look at those later, but most of that is going to come down or come apart then we're going to put a second story on it.

And rather than match the existing house with its stucco traditional details we're going to go in a very different direction. We're going to look at some new materials it's going to be kind of fun and kind of funky.

I see we’re gonna break those child labor laws again this year.

The soggy addition isn’t the only problem with the old house though. There’s an unusual crack.

And then we have this old equipment here, two condensers one that powered a minisplit, the other that powered the air handler up in the attic. This is all going to get replaced with some really cool new equipment from Mitsubishi. 

We're going to be removing the stucco off to right about this location here, and then this is all going to get some really cool AZEK cladding. 

Behind that, are some really awesome Benjamin Obdyke weather-resistant barrier technology.

The rest of the stucco is going to stay. it's in good shape, although someone painted it this color on purpose i don't know why...

These window wells are going to remain. There is good sandy soils and really good drainage, and that brings us to windows.

We're going to replace all of the windows in the house and we're going to fill all of those weight pockets with some froth pack from our good friends at DuPont so that the house is nice and efficient.

They're tough-minded, they're competitive, and they won't do a damn thing they don't want to do. They're also likely in a predatory aggression state (dominance behavior).

So, beware! Learn to stand up for yourself, speak the truth, and engage in conflict, even if it's the only way.

I just made this video for you. I think you’re going to love it, especially if you don’t always find it easy to be vulnerable with someone you’re dating.

Do you find it hard to truly let down your guard with a man? 

What do you do when you get angry or hurt? Do you get quiet? Passive-aggressive? Lash out?

If you know that the way you’re bringing things up isn’t productive, and has the tendency to push someone away, my new video is essential watching today...

Let me know what you think.

Raise your hand if this describes you: You start working toward a new goal with excitement, only to watch it eventually fizzle out to nothing. If you’re human, it’s likely you’ve experienced this phenomenon. Why is it some goals are just so hard to accomplish, whereas others we’re able to conquer with ease?


On today’s episode of The BiggerPockets Podcast, that’s exactly what you’ll discover. Diving deep into psychological research on goals, motivation, and time management, Brandon and David will pull back the curtain on how people set and accomplish big goals and give you a GPS toward changing your life forever.

We feel happy when good things happen, we feel sad when something bad happens around us, we feel scared when we think we're in danger; anger is the emotion that makes us feel annoyed, we feel disgusted when something repels us and we feel surprised when something unexpected happens. Regarding empathy, children will look at several situations any child can face in their day-to-day school environment. These examples will help to show what empathy is about so that children can learn how to put themselves in the place of other people. As for the self-esteem video, children will learn to know themselves, identify their positive and negative traits, discover how they perceive themselves and how others perceive them.

******************************************************************************************************// Video Notes:
Have you ever felt the anticipation after adding a new friend, as you wonder what to say to take your newfound friendship to the next level? This feeling gets even more intense on LinkedIn, as you rack your brains to build something meaningful with someone in a professional capacity. What do you start by saying, and where do you go from there? 

Making friends should not be this hard, and the same goes for professional connections on LinkedIn. The first thing to realize is that being accepted is just the first step in your journey to convert that connection into a genuine relationship. You want them to engage with your post and endorse you professionally, which is going to require some effort in networking. What steps should you take to bridge the gap even across the internet?

Step 1, Personalise your first message. As with every new friendship, the first message is critical. Remember that you are on a social media platform, and your connection will have an inbox full of introductions to look through. Think of your inbox. How do you choose which messages to look at or reply to? I always ignore the generic ones, such as “Great Profile!”. If they cannot find the effort to send messages that speak to me personally, would they be a value-added connection? I highly doubt so, and that’s what your new contacts will think too. Instead, personalize your messages by looking for something generic in their profile. Make sure it is something you genuinely found interesting, because tone can be hard to fake. An example could be to reference one of their posts, and ask how they got the inspiration for it. The question lets them know that you are genuinely interested, and that opens the door for future conversations as well. 

Step 2, Continue the conversation. Remember when I said to find something genuinely interesting to comment on? The chances are that if done right, step 1 would have led you to an actual conversation, and you would not want to be stuck discussing something you faked interest on. Everyone appreciates compliments, and since your message references their work, chances are they will send you a favorable reply. This could range from a simple thank you message, to more in-depth sharing. Follow up on the conversation, and consider sharing some articles you believe will interest them. By doing so, you display an understanding of the subject matter that should impress them. By sharing something that you have read, you also gain an opportunity to further the discussion, continuing to build a meaningful and professional relationship. If you have written any articles of your own, don’t hesitate to share those as well!

Step 3, Find common grounds. There are only that many articles you can share before he starts mistaking you for a news app. To take your conversation to another level, you need to find some similarities between both of you, before your stream of articles run out. This is a crucial step to establish yourself as a personal friend rather than just an active LinkedIn connection. The similarities would allow conversations to flow more naturally, such as reminiscing about your alma mater together. Bringing a personal aspect to that connection strengthens the relationship with your newfound friend. 

The above steps should bring you into their friend circle, and you will be able to communicate on personal terms. However, if you have tried reaching out in several ways and was repeatedly ignored, remember to stay respectable. It is easy to tell when their replies show that they are just not interested. There are millions of people on LinkedIn, find someone who you can genuinely build a meaningful connection with, rather than forcing it.","0","00:04:29",People & Blogs,"{#covid19,#startuplife,#startupgrind,#smallbusinesslife,#coronavirus,#remotework,#remoteworkforce,#remoteworking,#remoteworkers,#remoteworker,#corporateevents,#corporateevent,#teambuildingactivities,#teambuildingevent,#teambuilding,#eventproduction,linkedin}",NA,youtube,NA,Building meaningful connections_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXsN92t7vR4,Depersonalization

Emotional exhaustion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1ntSs5CgNQ,Emotional Exhaustion,The Vine,unknown,"2788","53",0,"0","19 March 2023 | All of us face a certain degree of emotional exhaustion. We need to understand is that God is, in an of himself, an emotional being. In other words, emotions are not in the first instance a human characteristic but a divine one. God has the ability to not only think and to will but also to feel. Scripture reveals a whole host of emotions God has – love, joy, peace, anger, compassion, passion, frustration, good. Because he has made us in His image, humans are also emotional beings. But of course we know that our emotions, like our minds and bodies, are influenced greatly by the fall of humanity into sin. God’s emotions are not impacted nor shaped by sin, but ours are.

This Reiki session is intended to assist you in slowing down the aging process at the cellular level.

Being in a sleep, awake, occupied or engaged in other activities while simultaneously 
receiving Reiki, will never impair from its effectiveness. 
Reiki always works for your highest good and most benevolent outcomes.

The infinite wisdom of Reiki flows only where it is desired, affecting matter at subtle levels. Your personal acceptance and openness to receiving this healing  energy will dictate the level of energy to receive.

You are encouraged to play this distance healing recording repeatedly as often  as you wish. This Reiki sessions can have cumulative effects, meaning, the healing  energy infused in these videos is amplified each time you play it.

Each of us has our unique response to the healing energy and our experience can indeed vary from session to session. It depends on how sensitive someone is to energy. Just relax and enjoy this healing energy flowing to you.

This is a ""real time"" Reiki session recorded from the beginning to end.  While channeling energy my focused and devoted attention will prevail throughout the session. Therefore, I do not speak and remain silent at all times. Soothing background music is used to further promote deeper relaxation during the session. 

In order for Reiki to work effectively, please be open to receiving the healing energy.
It is extremely beneficial to drink water after receiving Reiki as part of the healing process. 


Important Note: Treatment with Energy Healing such as Reiki - does not promise to cure any illness or condition nor replaces professional medical treatment.

I did everything possible to ensure that you really enjoy this Free Reiki Video Session and I will do everything in my power, in case you need any help. However, I want to put here clearly that I do not perform miracles and I do not promise to cure anyone. In critical situations, please, use your common sense and help yourself first by seeking qualified professional help. 

My services may be useful for many but not for everyone, so I wanted to emphasize that there are no promises, guarantees or representations that you will attain cure of any condition nor win or earn any money as a result of using any of my services. The use of any of my information, products and services should always be based on your own diligence, and you agree that I am not responsible in any way for your success nor failure. I am merely the facilitator who transmits channeled energy to you. Everything here mentioned is “energetically speaking” and that is the sole basis of my work.

However, no matter how diligently he searched, he couldn't find answers. Doug became consumed with increasing anxiety and fear, until he began to feel he couldn't take it anymore.

Finally, Doug heard about the Amen Clinics and decided that he may be able to find the answers he was looking for by scanning his brain. What they found in Doug's scan was that the cause of all Doug's problems came from a single, unlikely source. Armed with answers and a treatment plan, Doug's outlook changed dramatically.

Three months later, Doug returned to the clinic to see what his brain looked like, now that he had been taking steps to improve his brain health. The difference in the scan was incredible, and it was a validation that all the work he was putting in paid off.

In this video, I’m going to walk you through the steps to overcome adrenal fatigue.

Most fatigue problems and adrenal insufficiency come from issues with the adrenal glands. About 80% of the population deals with this common problem. There are several warning signs that indicate you may have adrenal fatigue. If you struggle with fatigue, are stressed, anxious, have trouble with concentration, poor memory, thyroid issues, or gained mysterious weight, you may have adrenal fatigue.
 
There are three steps you will want to take to get rid of adrenal fatigue for good. The first starts with your diet. Foods to get out of your diet are caffeine, sugar, and hydrogenated oils. Foods that are high in vitamin B12 and magnesium are going to support your adrenal glands and blood sugar levels so you will want to add these foods to your diet. Foods like coconut oil, coconut milk, coconut, olives, olive oil, raw dairy products, grass-fed butter, organic meats, loads of vegetables, and seaweed are all crucial to your diet as well.

Secondly, you will want to support your adrenals by taking supplements like adaptogenic herbs (such as ashwagandha, holy basil, and liquorice root), which will help your body adapt and deal with stress. Additionally, a vitamin B complex, magnesium, vitamin D, selenium will support the healing of your adrenals.

Lastly, you should focus on lowering your stress levels. Try getting 8-10 hours of sleep a night, reflect and address your stressors, add fun activities into your routine, and exercise. If you follow these three steps, you will be well on your way to naturally healing adrenal fatigue.

It's usually preceded by feelings of fatigue, stress, fear, or things like being tired all the time but unable to fall asleep.

Emotional exhaustion may also look like feeling stuck in life and unable to break the cycle.

With feelings like this, is there any way we can get relief?

Yes, there is! God loves you and wants a relationship with you! 

Take King David for example, when he trusted God with his very life he then wrote in gratitude for the peace he received.

God will reassure you that you are safe in his hands. And today, God can give you rest for your soul.

Most career and job search strategies bombard people with messages telling you to a-million-and-one things like: craft an outstanding resume, write an attention-grabbing cover letter, do an extensive job search, go networking often, reframe your weaknesses, upsell your strengths, impress the recruiters, and upgrade your technical skills.

While those may be a necessary part of the equation to building a meaningful career, it isn't the right place to start.  Starting there often leaves even the highest performing professional feeling frustrated, uninspired, and beginning to second guess themselves.

Job postings are like advertisements. They were written by hired hands to attract candidates.

You need to be applying business development strategies to your worthy career goals.

If you don't do this, you can count on having negative thoughts creeping in about what's wrong with your resume, your background, age, experience, or anything you might think is putting you at a disadvantage.

There's actually a science behind how to find work you love and create a fulfilling career from it. 

It's my proven method behind how I orchestrated my career journey with meaning and purpose. 

And it's based on my expertise on the brain and human behavior so that you can be contributing your fullest in a career you're passionate about and gives you the compensation you deserve.

CHI 2023: The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems
Session: Fostering Meaningful Virtual Connections

Despite the clear benefits that social connection offers to well-being, strangers in close physical proximity regularly ignore each other due to their tendency to underestimate the positive consequences of social connection. In a between-subjects study (N = 49 pairs, 98 participants), we investigated the effectiveness of a humanoid robot, a computer screen, and a poster at stimulating meaningful, face-to- face conversations between two strangers by posing progressively deeper questions. We found that the humanoid robot facilitator was able to elicit the greatest compliance with the deep conversation questions. Additionally, participants in conversations facilitated by either the humanoid robot or the computer screen reported greater happiness and connection to their conversation partner than those in conversations facilitated by a poster. These results suggest that technology-enabled conversation facilitators can be useful in breaking the ice between strangers, ultimately helping them develop closer connections through face-to-face conversations and thereby enhance their overall well-being.

Albert Bandura (1977), a pioneer humanist and father of the concept of self-efficacy, defined it as “people’s beliefs about their capabilities to produce designated levels of performance that exercise their influence over events that affect their lives” (Bandura, 1994).

Self-efficacy determines how we think and feel about ourselves. 

For example, imagine someone who aspires to become an Olympic Champion but is not sure about his athletic potential. He puts in all the effort and does his very best, but at the end of the day, he is unhappy as he lacks confidence in himself. What this person requires is self-efficacy – a strong sense of trust in himself.

In this video, I talk about ways you can increase your self-efficacy to reach your goals as an athlete, career-driven person, or even just in life.

Comment below if there are any techniques or ways you have used or found success with that has increased your self-efficacy??

Are you struggling to achieve work/life balance?

So was I...

... actually, I sucked at it.

I was that guy that would show up to parties and family functions strapped to his laptop  - don’t judge :).

I self-justified with the belief that it was all o.k because I was driven and the “haters” simply didn’t get it.

This flawed mindset cost me my friendships, my relationship at the time, and my health. 

I put on 20lbs (not muscle).

The struggle was brutal.

I didn’t want to stop building and scaling companies, but I didn’t want to end up alone, sick or dead either.

And it wasn’t until after selling my company Spheric that I really took some time to reflect and ask myself if there was a better way. 

Turns out there is... a much better way.

I call it work-life integration. 

That’s what I want to share with you in today's video...

Not only do I share my approach to integrating life into work, but I also talk about the 7 pillars of life that must be kept in harmony.

Here they are:

1. Health
2. Love
3. Friends
4. Finances
5. Mission
6. Hobby
7. Spirituality

Being aware of these pillars is great. 

Integrating them into your life is where transformation truly occurs.

Watch the video to learn how I track, measure and integrate them on a weekly basis to ensure my business grows… while my health and relationships continue to thrive. 

Also, I want to share a strategy called “NET” time (stands for No Extra Time) that I use to really get the most out of my day.

(after reading over 200+ personal development and productivity books, etc. I can confidently say that you won’t find this tip anywhere else)

Dive in now and learn how to start living a deeply integrated entrepreneurial life. 

With gratitude,

– Dan

ABOUT DAN MARTELL
=====================

“You can only keep what you give away.” That’s the mantra that’s shaped Dan Martell from a struggling 20-something business owner in the Canadian Maritimes (which is waaay out east) to a successful startup founder who’s raised more than $3 million in venture funding and exited not one... not two... but three tech businesses: Clarity.fm, Spheric and Flowtown.

You can only keep what you give away. That philosophy has led Dan to invest in 33+ early stage startups such as Udemy, Intercom, Unbounce and Foodspotting. It’s also helped him shape the future of Hootsuite as an advisor to the social media tour de force. 

An activator, a tech geek, an adrenaline junkie and, yes, a romantic (ask his wife Renee), Dan has recently turned his attention to teaching startups a fundamental, little-discussed lesson that directly impacts their growth: how to scale. You’ll find not only incredible insights in every moment of every talk Dan gives - but also highly actionable takeaways that will propel your business forward. Because Dan gives freely of all that he knows. After all, you can only keep what you give away.

Your employees don’t contribute, they lack motivation, but they are always looking for better pay? In this video I’ll show you how to fix this.

How to motivate employees in the workplace - Extrinsic motivation vs intrinsic motivation

You May think, money is attractive, but it has no sustained impact on employee motivation nor on employee commitment!

Please don’t take this the wrong way. If you don’t pay your employees an adequate income, then you’ll demotivate your employees! They will not be commited to work for you.

But the inverse conclusion will only work on an exception basis: If you pay an above average income, this will by no means result in your employees being more motivated or more commited over the long haul.

There is an important difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. What that difference is, why you need to have intrinsically motivated employees and how to get them, that’s what I show you in this video.

Full 8th Grade mental health lesson included!

RESILIENCE: the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties; toughness.

Notice the ups and downs of classroom energy throughout the activity. The group of students were presented with a challenge-- watch and listen in as the class battles failure to finally achieve success.

The tennis ball toss stirred the classroom with just a bit of movement to boost brain activity. The props are analogies, and this metaphorical look at mental health is meant to create connections and deeper understanding. This also helped create social connectedness, which is a huge piece in a person's developing mental health.

You'll hear this group socialize throughout the activity. The reactions and chatter are all on-task; students are engaged and learning-- the quick side conversations are allowed because you'll hear they all involve thoughts about the class activity. Often, teenagers blurt out questions or comments because that's how they learn. These don't always need a response. In fact, you'll hear the group get louder and then quiet down to absolute silence as they internalize specific analogies presented to them.

Subsequent lessons take the focus off of the teacher and allow students to be the central part of activities. We will reflect through small group discussions, journaling, and further activities to develop life skills.

Health concepts in this lesson/unit: resiliency, coping strategies, decision making, influence analysis, bullying, upstanding behavior, peer pressure, self-esteem, and social connectedness.

Emotional exhaustion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZk90baM79o,Tired On The Inside | Pastor Steven Furtick | Elevation Church,Elevation Church,unknown,"3439772","81258",0,"11569","“I’m tired.” Have you said that lately? When you’re tired on the inside, it’s all too easy to feel drained, overwhelmed, and like nothing is going to change.

In “Tired On The Inside,” Pastor Steven shares from the story of the woman at the well in John 4, showing us how powerful rest can be –– if we’re looking for it in the right places. 

But what if one of the reasons we’re tired all the time is because we’ve been going to the wrong well? What if we’ve been running to sources of stress instead of God’s source of rest?

Being weary doesn’t mean we’re weak. Maybe it just means we’ve been “filling up” in the wrong places. Maybe we’re tired because we’ve been pushing against what God is trying to call us into.

He said, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11 verse 28). 

Are you ready for true rest?

Enhancing well-being at work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0bdCLF2CV0,How to Improve Wellbeing at Work,Sydney Corporate Yoga,unknown,"159","0",0,"0","Management support is crucial to the success of any workplace wellness program.

As leaders, managers have the opportunity to build supportive work environments that promote employee health and well-being. Employee wellness is a smart investment for today’s managers. Research has shown the link connecting employee health behaviors with healthcare costs and the bottom line.

Numerous companies are looking to reduce healthcare costs while also fostering happy, productive employees. As of 2015, more than two-thirds of U.S. employers currently offer wellness programs to help facilitate healthy workplace behaviors. While this is a great start, it’s important to realize that simply putting a wellness program into place isn’t enough. Employees need a manager’s support to create a thriving culture of wellness and sustainable behavior change.

In many cases, HR professionals spend a lot of effort convincing senior management to support wellness. In reality, it’s actually the middle managers that hold the key to changing workplace culture. Employees want their managers to give them permission and say that it’s okay to walk at lunch or attend a company yoga class.

But I love this idea of coming in close contact with the awareness and understanding of what it feels like to bring energy to something. Often we are energizing things that are not serving us, whether it is through our thoughts, actions, our daily rituals, our habits. 

This practice gives us the tools to notice that where our attention goes… energy flows.

Today we begin with the breath of fire, to stir the pot energetically, and give you the juice you need for this rejuvenating flow.

It’s important to develop good relationships at work. They improve happiness, trust and engagement. Here are five ways to build strong, positive relationships at work! 

1. Schedule time to build relationships. Pop over to a colleague’s desk, offer a coffee, or reply to a social media post. Devote time to building relationships, even if it’s just a few minutes a day.

2. Develop your emotional intelligence. Understanding your own emotional needs can help you to empathize with others.

3. Appreciate others. Everyone wants to feel appreciated. Whether it’s the CEO or the janitor, show your appreciation by complimenting a job well done.

4. Manage your boundaries. Building friendships is important. But if a relationship becomes distracting, it’s important to take action. Set clear boundaries around when and where it’s acceptable to socialize.

5. Avoid gossiping. If you are experiencing conflict with a colleague, gossiping will only exacerbate the problem. Instead, talk directly to the person involved and find a way to work together amicably.

Good relationships can improve all aspects of your working life and open doors to career progression.","0","00:01:58",Education,"{""work relationship"",connection,networking,friendship,socialize,""work friend"",ally,""communication skills""}",NA,youtube,NA,Building positive relationships_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB8zoAvC8g0,Depersonalization

Learn how to ACTUALLY achieve your goals (no more BS)…

Goal setting is so much a key to success that it’s cliché. We know it, but the truth is that most of us don’t do it.   
People who explicitly make resolutions are 10 times more likely to attain their goals than people who don’t. 10. Times. More. Likely. Those are some good odds!
But, the truth is that what sets successful people apart is WHY they are doing it—you see, they know what they REALLY want… not what they “should” want… and they EXECUTE in a consistent way.

And then they use the 4 steps of success to get from point A to point B.

1) A clear GOAL you actually want
2) A proven strategy for BRAINSTORMING exactly what you need to do
3) A PLAN that reverse-engineers your goal into actionable steps
3) A “TA-DA” LIST to know what to do next (Note: a “ta-da” list is more effective than a “to-do” list because instead of a boring list of tasks, it’s a list of reasons to say “ta-da” when you check it off!)

Stop wasting your time and potential. No more BS… find out what it will take and how to actually achieve your goals with the videos in this playlist! _________________________

Self care is what's needed for your well-being and should always leave you with more energy and feelings of revitalization.

-nourishing foods, 
-stillness & movement,

Empathy doesn’t sound sexy, but it’s like still water that runs deep. It’s like roots of giant trees you wonder how can possibly stand so tall. And, yet, so few people are actually empathetic. Why Because you have never, not ever, had an experience that you were not at the absolute center of. Your thoughts and feelings about those experiences are automatic.

My experience of the same scene needs to be communicated to you. My feelings need to be communicated to you. And even if I did that perfectly, you still wouldn’t be able to know exactly how I feel. That’s because my current experience (with you) is nuanced by all the other experiences I’ve had. Which, by the way, you haven’t had!

So, how is one to become a better person, better communicator, better at understanding their friends, partners, and spouses. How does one become better at providing service or anticipating reactions or so many other desired life and business skills?

You need to stop being automatic. The formula is not hard. The practice and execution are excruciatingly hard. So hard that so many give up so easily. So? So, don’t let that be you!

Join me for today’s video to learn a simple, yet very effective formula for developing empathy!

We discuss how depression is a mental illness that can cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and disinterest in the world around us. We then look at how these symptoms can impact our ability to engage with others, causing us to withdraw from social interactions and struggle to understand their perspectives.

We also discuss how this empathy deficit can create a cycle of isolation and loneliness, as others may not understand or connect with our experiences. However, we also highlight the importance of seeking help and support, as therapy and medication can help manage depression symptoms and improve our ability to connect with others.","0","00:02:30",People & Blogs,{},NA,youtube,NA,Empathy deficit_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJGDGRmgqOM,Depersonalization

#empathstories #empathy #EmotionalConnection

What exactly is empathy? German psychologists coined the term more than a
century ago, and now it has two main meanings. The traditional approach is to think of
empathy as an emotional connection between people. A different approach, and one that I
believe is essential to the art of living, is empathy as a leap of imagination to understand the
world from another person's perspective. When you open a psychology textbook, you
usually encounter the first approach, which defines empathy as the ability to share or
participate in the emotional lives of others. In other words, we can feel what another person
feels, for example, when you feel anxious, when you see the face of a child crying anxiously.
Every time you tremble when you see someone in pain, you are showing empathy.
This sharing of experiences differs from sympathy, when your response does not mirror
theirs, such as pitying someone who feels helpless after the death of a family member. Such
empathy is usually seen as an innate quality over which we have little control, a product of
our nature that often competes unpleasantly with our selfish inner desires, our aggression
and cruelty. In recent decades, social psychologists and evolutionary biologists have
emphasized this previously neglected aspect of our being and social relationships. They
argue that it is as natural to feel the pains and joys of others, and to suffer or enjoy with
them, as it is to feel concern for our own well-being. We all have this capacity for empathy,
although it may be more developed in some groups than others, such as women more than
men (a controversial finding), or among family members more than strangers.
Neuroscientists have conducted experiments that show how our empathic feelings toward
others differ from our feelings toward ourselves. The image below shows the differences
seen when people imagine their finger being pushed through a door versus when they

imagine the same thing happening to someone else: different neural mechanisms are at
work.
Different parts of the brain light up when we think of ourselves in pain (above) and
when we think of someone else in pain (below). Our ability to participate in the emotional
lives of other individuals is apparently the result of an evolutionary constraint: a mother who
feels the pain of her children is more likely to care for them and ensure their survival; and
community members who are sensitive to the needs and sufferings of each other can be
more successful, especially if they depend on each other in some way (such as for food or
protection).
But what I'm interested in here is a different kind of empathy, but one that involves
expanding yourself beyond your ego and self-interest. It is empathy as the imaginative act of
stepping into another person's shoes and seeing the world from their perspective. This
requires developing an understanding of their hopes, fears, ambitions, beliefs, prejudices
and other aspects of their worldview. Seeing the world from the perspective of others is
sometimes called ""perspective taking.""∗ We do it all the time, and it can be seen in common
phrases like ""I see what you're thinking,"" ""I really know where you"" re at .” de', 'What must he
feel?' or 'Wouldn't you hate to be him?'. Unlike the first form of empathy, this second type of
perspective-taking empathy is a product of nurture rather than nature, a part of our nature
that we have more power to influence and develop. I think it is an art that can be cultivated.
But how do you do that? The art of empathic imagination The Christian tradition
contains a seemingly precious ideal that you should do to others like you. would have them
do to you."" The problem is that it prioritizes your perspective over theirs. George Bernard
Shaw knew this when he quipped, ""Do not do unto others as you would have them do unto
you.

Rejuvenating energy levels,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOlDknY9Td8,“Pranic Rejuvenation and Healing” Guided Meditation | Recharge Your Body with Energy,Kyrian,"4","12155","220",0,"11","This pranic rejuvenation guided meditation is ideal for healing and recharging. Using your breath to bring wellness and relaxation to your body and mind.
⭐ More free guided meditations - http://bit.ly/2qiNAKJ

This is one of the most ancient, yet simple Yoga exercises. If done correctly, you will clearly feel the energy filling your body and recharging your every cell (especially if you do the advanced version as explained more below).
The meditation is traditionally done lying down on your back, with your head facing north and your arms at your side. Nevertheless, you may certainly try to do it in any position comfortable for you, even sitting down.

☆ Specific benefits of this practice:
==============
1. Activates the healing and rejuvenating processes of the body.
2. Recharges body and mind.
3. Enhance oxygen absorption through the apneas (the contraction of the spleen causes a higher level of blood cells to circulate).
4. The deep breathing improves cardiac activity and facilitates the return flow of the venous blood to the heart and lungs.
5. The focus on the pineal gland facilitates the activation and well-functioning of this very precious gland.

☆ Advanced Pranic Rejuvenation – How-To
=============
This guided meditation is perfect for beginners, because the apneas are quite short.
With the practice, one should become able to hold his breath up to 30 seconds and even more, while at the same time becoming intensely aware of every part of the body that is being charged with energy.
For extremely powerful results, every part of the body should be perceived three-dimensionally, with all its internal organs as well. Ideally, you should perceive the energy filling first the most internal layers of each area, to expand then towards the surface, up to an inch beyond the skin, forming a force field.
Apart from the ability to visualize the different parts of the body, an even more important factor is to develop a kinesthetic sensibility, physically feeling the energy vibration.
In time one should become able to feel warmth, tingling or similar feelings clearly.
I suggest practicing the pranic rejuvenation for no less than 15 minutes at a time, if necessary passing again on the same areas of the body or lengthening the final part when you focus on the pineal gland.

Building resilience is something that takes time, but will make you a stronger advocate, whatever your passion may be.

She is a social change advocate for healthcare reform, mental health destigmatization, and policy reform regarding the opioid crisis.

Developing empathy at work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYs4THQ9o1M,Helping Children Develop Empathy and a Sense of Justice,CECE Early Childhood Videos at Eastern CT State U.,unknown,"4601","42",0,"0","Discussion and reflection questions for this video: https://www.easternct.edu/center-for-early-childhood-education/equity/empathy-and-justice.html

In this video, renowned educator and author Vivian Paley explains the importance of supporting the development of children's empathy and sense of justice from their earliest days. She developed a pedagogy she called ""doing stories,"" in which children would dictate and then act out stories from their own play, and she found that children would consistently act from a deep sense of compassion and fairness. She believed that early childhood was the ideal time to start helping children ""learn to care about every other person’s feelings, beliefs and welfare"" (From ""Starting Small: Teaching Tolerance in Preschool and the Early Grades,"" Southern Poverty Law Center, 1997).

Over her long career, Paley observed that young children had a keen sense of fairness and empathy--making early childhood the ideal time to engage in social justice pedagogy. Paley believed children went to kindergarten knowing three things: stories, how to play, and a sense of fairness. She tapped into this knowledge by developing social justice pedagogy that she called ""doing stories."" By asking children to dictate and then act out the stories they were originally doing in play, Paley found that children would consistently and pervasively act from a deep sense of kindness, empathy, and justice. As children worked together, she found they would center (or re-center) their stories on equity and fairness. As an active observer of children ""doing stories,"" Paley was able to highlight and support the decisions children made, helping to heighten their self-awareness and awareness of others. In this way, her work demonstrates how educators can and must teach young children on the complexities and importance of social justice and anti-racism. Early childhood is, in fact, the ideal time to teach these concepts.

The CECE interviewed Vivian Paley in Chicago in 2010 about ""doing stories"" for a video series on oral language development, written by Dr. Theresa Bouley (https://www.easternct.edu/center-for-early-childhood-education/oral-language-development/index.html). This video was created in 2021 from unused portions of that interview.

Vivian Paley passed away in 2019, but her legacy lives on.

But I figure if it’s something that I deal with quite often, it’s likely something you deal with too.

I’m an ambitious man. And, like any high-achiever, the stress and frustration of not experiencing the results we desire as quickly as we’d like gets to us from time to time.

So, I thought I’d share with you a couple of counterintuitive ideas for getting yourself out of the funk you’re in and back into the battle.

I wish I could tell you that being a hard-charger was easy. It isn’t. It’s actually really stressful at times.

But the older I get the more I realize that a man’s ability to pump on the brakes from time to time is what allows him to go as fast as possible other times.

FURTHER READING

You can read more on this and other subjects on our blog, here: https://bit.ly/2zLuEXc

“There is a certain sort of relationship that is alternately passionate, fiery and painfully unfulfilling – and that tends to puzzle both outsiders and its participants; a relationship between one person who is, as psychologists put it, anxiously attached and another who is avoidantly attached.
There is, in such couplings, a constant game of push and pull. The anxiously attached party typically complains – more or less loudly – that their partner is not responsive enough: they accuse them of being emotionally distant, withholding, cold and perhaps physically uninterested too. The avoidant lover, for their part, stays relatively quiet but in their more fed-up moments, complains that the anxious party is far too demanding, possibly ‘mad’ and, as they put it pejoratively, ‘needy’. One person seems to want far too much, the other far too little.”

So where do we draw the line between emotional concern and detachment?

Creating a supportive work environment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFDMf4Oay0o,How do I create a positive work environment? | The Career Ride - Episode 15,Dr. JOB PRO,unknown,"2357","8",0,"0","Hello and welcome back to Dr Jobs channel today we will be looking at creating a positive working culture and the importance of creating a positive working culture.   Good culture is always led by the leadership or management team and enforced through the workforce by living that positive culture themselves. Enforcing a positive culture without living it can create a negative effect.   Some of the benefits of having a positive working culture are having an increased retention rate which means that you have a low turnover and you only look at growth. On average it costs an organisation up to $4,000 to induct and onboard an employee. This is beneficial for the organisation if it is in growth mode but not to replace current leavers.   Having a positive culture can also impact the well being of the employees and is connected to numerous health benefits, increased productivity, and less stress. Happy employees are more involved in their work, so it’s a win-win all around.  Finally having a positive working culture will lead to engagement within the organisation which all in all effect results in productivity and business growth.  Other benefits can include attracting top talent and beating competitors within the sector.  The next question you may have is- how can I create a positive culture? That's exactly what I am going to tell you now.   1. Show gratitude - Gratitude is extremely beneficial in the workplace because it enables the cultivation of respect, trust, and common appreciation among associates. Some organisations have shout outs of good work or a strategy where colleagues can nominate each other for good work.  2. Use encouraging communication-  Communicating positively and constructively will be accepted well by those who receive your feedback. Your message must be personal, encouraging, passionate, and empowering. Always remember- a positive statement will always have more influence.  3. ‘Thank you’ is powerful - a simple acknowledgement and thank you goes a long way. This can be a little email or message to show appreciation.  4. Little wins count just as much as the big ones- make sure you appreciate the little wins and they are the ones that enable the big wins and always appreciate the effort of the colleagues that have made that possible.  5. Smile and develop a relationship- smiling is contagious and makes people feel instantly happier. Smiling at someone creates a relationship bond and conversation starter. It's important to discover ways of relating to your colleagues. Team building days and regular check-ins are great ways to cultivate healthy relationships with colleagues.   6. Finally, remember to always know what your goal is. This will enable you to know the organisation's mission and most importantly keep on track. It also helps with days that are not so good and needs a boost of energy.  Positivity is significant because it improves your coping skills and abilities and shapes resilience.

Professional growth and development,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekX3CIz-Yec,The Only 3 Career Steps that Matter | Rosabeth Moss Kanter | TEDxBeaconStreet,TEDx Talks,unknown,"61961","735",0,"19","Whether entrepreneur or employee, scientist or journalist, young graduate or top leader, there are just three big career transitions that matter: inclusion, influence, and impact. Opportunities and barriers at each stage can be different for women or minorities, but knowing the challenges can help overcome them - and create change for self and others on the road to success and happiness. 
Rosabeth Moss Kanter wrote her first novel at the age of 11. Not one to rest on her childhood laurels, Kanter’s ambition and fierce intellect earned her a BA in sociology and English Literature from Bryn Mawr, followed by an MA and PhD in Sociology from the University of Michigan. Her dissertation on 19th-century utopian communities set the stage for a long and incredibly distinguished career in business research and academia. Kanter taught at Brandeis, Harvard and Yale before joining the faculty at Harvard Business School as the Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor of Business and director and chair of the Harvard University Advanced Leadership Initiative. A prolific writer, Kanter has published numerous books on business management, gender and race in the workplace. She served as economic adviser to Michael Dukakis during the 1988 presidential election, co- founded Goodmeasure, Inc. a consulting firm that counts IBM and British Airways among its clients, and was the last academic to edit the Harvard Business Review. Kanter’s numerous accolades include 23 honorary degrees, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and an award in her name, which recognizes the best in work-family research. A trail-blazer by any measure, Kanter was named one of Boston Magazine’s “50 most powerful women” and one of Good Housekeeping’s “125 women who changed our world.” This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

In this video, we discuss what healthy relationships and unhealthy relationships look like.

Relationships should be fun and exciting, but sometimes they can be tough. Resolving conflict and different wants and needs is part of having healthy relationships with friends, family, significant others, and coworkers. 

Some relationships are confusing, and it is hard to know if a relationship is healthy. A lot of it boils down to good communication and whether you can be your true self in the relationship.

If they speak to you in a disrespectful way, make you feel inferior, blame you for things that aren’t your fault, or physically or sexually hurt or harass you, that person is not good for you. 

It is ok to say “no” to people and distance yourself from them.

Healthy relationships should feel good for both people. You can only control your own behavior and you are not responsible for other people’s potentially bad behavior.

However, 1 of 4 employees views their jobs as the number one stressor in their lives. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted a research which shows that 40 percent of workers have very or extremely stressful jobs. According to the American Institute of Stress (AIS), job pressure is the number one cause of stress in the United States followed by money, health, and relationships. In Japan, almost 2,000 people committed suicide in 2017 due to work-related problems, as per statistics, which is why tips and tricks to manage workplace stress are important.

How to recover from mental fatigue
How To Recover From Mental Fatigue Fast
Mental Fatigue, End it (Today)
Are you fatigued? Does your brain seek to take a long vacation far from where you are right now? You may be feeling mentally worn out.
These days, it's all too common to feel mentally exhausted. Our minds are feeling beyond worn out due to uncertainty, high levels of stress, and a demanding lifestyle. On the other hand, enduring endless mental Fatigue can have negative effects on our personal and professional well-being.
Let's examine how mental Fatigue affects us, its signs, and possible treatments.
What is mental Fatigue?
Similar to how a person can become physically exhausted after engaging in strenuous exercise, mental exhaustion and stress can also lead to mental exhaustion. This happens when you're consistently overloaded and don't have enough time for adequate rest and recovery, which causes cognitive fatigue. It might be challenging for you to concentrate on one task at a time, solve problems, or make executive decisions
Here are 10 tips to reduce mental fatigue
#1. Make a self-care plan.
Create a self-care plan that is suited to your needs and concentrate on your well-being. Choose a few routines that truly make you happy. These can be practices like meditation, deep breathing, being outside, or anything else that enhances your physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

#2. Perform a routine exercise
One of the best methods to lessen the effects of mental Fatigue is regular exercise. A recent study found that regardless of your age or gender, more physical activity makes you feel less tired.
You get a boost of energy, feel better about yourself, and get a better sleep when you exercise, whether it's outside or virtually. Exercises that improve cardiovascular health and build muscle also aid in the treatment of fibromyalgia and the prevention of other illnesses.
#3. Consume a balanced diet.
Your mental well-being is directly impacted by what you put into your body. Serotonin levels are raised by consuming adequate amounts of water and gut-healthy foods. Your immune system, resilience, and mental energy all benefit from high levels of serotonin.

#4. Correct circadian rhythm issues
One typical cause or symptom of brain fog is sleep deficiency. Reset your sleep clock and work on your sleep hygiene if you're not getting enough sleep.
Getting more restful sleep reduces anxiety and stress, which lessens the signs of mental Fatigue. You can seek out a mental health professional for medical guidance or treatment if you're experiencing insomnia.
#5. Let Go of Perfectionism
You may struggle with perfectionism if you often take on too many tasks. Unfortunately, this habit just serves to extend fatigue and a weakened sense of self-worth. Instead, make an effort to just concentrate on being good enough and try your best to accept the rest.
#6. Stay Connected
When under stress, a lot of people cut off contact with their loved ones, but this can be harmful. Call a friend or arrange to meet up with them the next time you're feeling stressed. These connections have the power to heal deeply.
#7. Limit Distractions When Working
Place your phone in another room or silence. Decide limits on how often you'll play games or check on social media. To let coworkers know when you are working and unavailable, you might want to consider posting a sign on your door.
#8. Take Regular Breaks Throughout the Day
While ""powering through"" can seem like the best tactic, research proves that most people perform better when breaks are scheduled into their schedule. We all require some downtime. Try the Pomodoro technique, where you set a timer for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. Take a longer 20–30 minute break following four intervals.
#9. Prioritize Important Tasks When Your Energy Is Highest
Most likely, you are aware of when you are ""at your best."" Therefore, if you are a morning person, try to schedule meetings and critical tasks first thing. If you're more productive in the afternoon or evening, take care of the simpler issues first. Your mental energy will rise as a result of this.

Many of us are exhausted by these “unprecedented times” and feeling overwhelmed at the prospect of COVID-19 restrictions lasting well into the holidays and through the winter— restrictions that will no doubt limit our gatherings with family and friends, increasingly isolating us. How do we deal with the mental health implications of COVID-19 isolation during the holiday season and long winter months, a season that many of us find stressful even under non-pandemic conditions?

Clinical Psychologist, Dr. Stephen Cole, Manager of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health’s Employee Assistance Program and Susan Stearns, Deputy Director of NAMI-NH explore this question and many others as part of our Healthy Living Series.

New research is indicating that employees are putting in more hours than ever, experiencing burnout and exposure to added stressors such as finances or the inability to separate personal and professional commitments and roles. These shifts and changes are pushing employee well-being up the ladder of corporate priorities.

This presents a significant challenge for leaders. Keeping in mind the responsibility to create the conditions for people to do their best work, they are grappling with questions of how to can they strategically invest in mental health, provide mental health resources, train managers, and mold their cultures to help employees navigate the future of work.

Leading organizations are stepping up, focused on a central question: how can they create supportive and psychologically safe workplaces—and sustain the benefits for the long-term?

In recognition of Mental Illness Awareness Week, join a discussion examining the challenges and responsibilities employers face in taking care of their employee’s mental health.

Though burnout has long been a problem in healthcare, the pandemic has made the issue significantly worse. With record numbers of healthcare professionals experiencing burnout, many are considering leaving their jobs - and the healthcare industry entirely - because of it.

We’ll hear from Figure 1 members sharing their own burnout experiences in healthcare and sit down with PhD candidate Chelsie Smith for her insights on how to spot and prevent burnout amongst healthcare professionals.

I seem to be constantly busy and the days blend into one"".

""Sadly, being constantly busy can lead to burn out. Burnout is a state of mental and physical exhaustion that can zap the joy out of your career, friendships, and family interactions. Continual exposure to stressful situations, like caring for an ill family member, working long hours, or witnessing upsetting news related to politics and school safety can lead to this stress condition."" *

This is why it is so important to take time out and calm your mind, whether it is for 5 mins or 5 hours. This beautiful and calming piece of music by Sleep Easy Relax is the perfect musical companion to assist you in taking that time out and relaxing and help prevent you burning out.

Find a quiet spot and list to the blended soft tones and gentle background  as you heal with this calm and relaxing music.

When things become competitive, we forget to consider how our actions affect others. It is important to remember that empathy is a crucial factor in human connection. As leaders, it is our responsibility to foster a safe space where people’s feelings matter and feel understood. Kenneth Santos Chang is a graduate of the Singapore Management University where he completed his Masters Degree in Business Management. Having lived in Canada, Singapore, and the Philippines, his passion for philanthropy and self-development led him to work with global brands and non-profit organizations. He has seen first hand the consequences a business faces when empathy isn’t cultivated and authenticity is lost. With the exaggerated emphasis on social media metrics and quantifiable measures, people have lost sight of the emotional and human connection. This pushed him on a mission to bring awareness of this topic in the community. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Even for this increasingly online world, 2020 was a total game-changer; in this interactive webinar, Roni Schrenk illustrates how to adapt to and even take advantage of today’s shifting rules of digital networking.

In her 2 years since graduating from The College, Roni Schrenk has worked diligently to build a robust online professional profile with a combination of mentorship, consultation, and education. Her work as an Extracurricular and Leadership consultant for Crimson Education was especially impacted by the pandemic, as she found herself brainstorming and problem-solving with over 30 students from 15 different countries to answer the question people are asking themselves all around the world these days: what do we do when our plans are upturned and the precarity of the world makes it more or less impossible to make new plans for the future?

Networking has been the buzzword of professional development for ages, and utilizing the internet to do so is far from new. As the balance shifts to be increasingly, and in some cases exclusively, online, professionals need to be especially intentional about how they make use of digital tools in their networking pursuits.

About Our Speaker:
Roni Schrenk graduated from The College in 2018, where she studied Global Studies and Human Rights, worked as an RA for Wendt House and as a designer for the CPO, UCSC, and CLI, and was an active member of Fire Escape Films. After graduation, Roni moved to Vienna, Austria with the support of a Fulbright Community-Based Combined grant, primarily working as an English language assistant in two Viennese high schools. She simultaneously began to develop a robust digital professional profile, consisting of both online teaching and mentorship with students of all ages for Crimson Education and BoldABC, as well as working remotely for the innovative Aira Tech Corp to support people with blindness. With the onslaught of the pandemic, Roni has been able to dedicate an increasing amount of time towards building her online pursuits and networks, and sees technology as a remarkable resource for connecting in meaningful and productive ways.","0","00:42:23",Education,{},NA,youtube,NA,Building meaningful connections_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGBAuH3NR50,Depersonalization

Promoting interpersonal connections,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJTDEPIe8S8,Enhancing Interpersonal Communication Skills Webinar,The Center for Corporate and Professional Development,unknown,"2097","15",0,"4","How many times after a difficult conversation with someone have you thought: 

• “Why didn’t I say what was really bothering me?” 
• “The other person had me so mixed up that I lost track of what we were talking about.” 

If you have ever experienced one of these thoughts, you are not alone. Keeping a focus on the real issue in difficult conversations is often the most important interpersonal communication skill that people would like to master. 

Emotions interfere with our ability to identify and maintain focus on the issue during high-stakes interactions. We are often eloquent after the conversation is over because emotions have subsided and rational thought is now in command of our thinking. Sometimes the emotion lingers, however, resulting in grudges, plans for evening the score and counter attacks. When this happens, the original issue may be lost in an on-going drama that can last a lifetime. 

The good news is that we can train ourselves to keep our communication issue-focused. The most important step is to understand what the “issue” really is so that you recognize it and address it appropriately. 

In this webinar, Kent State facilitator Deborah Easton will discuss the following concepts: 

• Identifying the Real Issue Behind Emotional Interactions 
• Recognizing How Conversations Lose Issue Focus 
• Understanding the Effect That Keeping Focused on the Issue has in Not Only the Immediate Conversation, but also in the Long-term Relationship 
• Responding with Issue-focused Word Choice, Despite the Fact That the Other Person is Attempting to “Push Our Buttons” or Distract Us 

The ability to focus on the issue takes practice and, in heated discussions, what seems like super-human strength.

The interview question, WHAT MOTIVATES YOU is a very difficult one to answer! How you answer it could be the difference between a pass or a fail!

WHY IS THE INTERVIEWER ASKING YOU THE QUESTION, WHAT MOTIVATES YOU?
Well, this is actually a trick interview question, and the hiring manager is asking it because they want to assess your motivations for work, what drives you personally, and how you are going to impact their team if they give you the job!

NEVER answer this interview question by saying you are motivated by money, by perks of the job, by promotion, or by anything outside of work that could put you across as self-centered.

Now, before I give you the perfect answer to the interview question, WHAT MOTIVATES YOU, there are 8 things you can say that motivate you that will make the interviewer sit up and listen! 

1. You are motivated by DEADLINES AND PRESSURE. If you have set timeframes to work towards, and you need to act quickly whilst under pressure, this can be a great motivator because it makes you feel you are valued at work! This also tells the interviewer you will take ownership of difficult tasks!

2. You are motivated by RESPONSIBILITY & HAVING LOTS OF VARIED TASKS TO DO AT WORK! This is a great motivator because it shows you to be someone who needs to be pushed and challenged at work, and this is obviously the perfect type of employee to have in any team!

3. You are motivated by ANALYSING DATA AND INFORMATION with a view to making improvements at work. This shows that you enjoy investigating things and coming up with creative ways to help the business improve.

4. You are motivated by CHALLENGING TARGETS (this is great for sales roles). Being motivated by targets shows you are a driven and self-motivated person.

5. You are motivated by DOING EVERYTHING TO A HIGH STANDARD AND ON TIME! If you have high standards then this is a great motivator because you feel everything is done exactly as it should be, and you will insist other people in your team do the same! This also communicates to the interviewer that you are organized and reliable.

6. You are motivated by MAKING SURE YOUR FAMILY ARE PROVIDED FOR, they are safe, secure and healthy. You understand that this can only be achieved if you do a good job at work, and you impress your manager!

7. You are motivated by CONTINUALLY LEARNING AND IMPROVING. If you are the type of person who is always open to learning new things and developing yourself professionally, this is very attractive to an employer!

8. You are motivated by GOALS AND ACHIEVEMENT! This is a great motivator for me personally because if I have something to work towards, it makes me feel good about myself! Every week I set myself targets to achieve which means I am continually progressing and moving forward in my business!

Job satisfaction and burnout,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM0rmKmIg2Q,How Managers Handle Employee Burnout,Etactics,"1","581","3",0,"0","If I asked you if you’ve ever been overwhelmed by work, a majority of you would say yes. I’m confident in saying that, since employee stress is one of the top sources of stress for Americans. 61% of people say that work is a factor in their stress. In fact, this is such a common problem that it deserves its own definition within the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases.

 ____________________________________________

https://etactics.com/blog/employee-burnout-statistics
____________________________________________

The World Health Organization includes a description for burnout in ICD-11. This description relates to stress, negativity, and emotional exhaustion specifically resulting from one’s job. It’s described as an occupational phenomenon because burnout is affecting so many people in the workplace. 77% of people have reported feeling burned out at their current job. Because it impacts so many workers, managers need to take steps to improve the situation so their employees stay productive. 

Unfortunately, most workers don’t think their managers are doing enough to help the situation. Around 70% say that their employers don’t do enough to prevent or ease burnout. 21% say this because their company doesn’t offer any helpful programs or initiatives. Even worse, 36% say that their organization is doing nothing to help with the problem. This could make employees feel like the company doesn’t care about their struggles. Only 21% felt like they could have open and productive conversations with human resources about solutions to burnout. 56% said that HR didn’t even encourage these conversations. But even though many workers don’t have the support they need to manage work stress, they still believe there are ways that employers can help. 

For 56% of people, flexibility was overwhelmingly listed as the top way that their company could support them. In fact, more managers are starting to recognize the importance of flexibility. A survey found that this was the most popular solution by managers. 34% of employees said that their company was increasing flexibility to try to solve the problem. A survey found that 90% of virtual workers and 77% of on-site workers took advantage of this flex scheduling benefit. 

Another way that managers are addressing burnout is with paid time off. This includes vacation time and mental health days. A majority of Americans don’t use all of their vacation time. And even when they do, coworkers and bosses still contact them during their time off for work-related reasons. This only disrupts their work-life balance. Managers should instead encourage their employees to take vacation time. Around 80% of people say that they’d take more time off work if their employers supported and encouraged them to do so. 36% of employees say that more paid time off would reduce burnout. This vacation time can increase job satisfaction and productivity, which benefits employees and the company. And most managers do see the results of this. 84% of them reported that their employees had increased productivity after a break. 

Finally, managers simply provide more support to their staff to ease burnout. Like I mentioned before, many employees feel a lack of this from their company and HR departments. They don’t feel like they can talk about their struggles with burnout, and they feel limited support with taking time off work. However, support from management is shown to decrease burnout, which is why companies are making it a priority to provide this. Workers with strong support from their managers are 70% less likely to feel burned out on a regular basis. 

Since so many people experience stress from their jobs, it’s no surprise that the World Health Organization classifies burnout as an occupational problem. It’s one of the main stressors for people across the country and affects a majority of working adults. Because of this, managers need to find solutions to ease burnout. Many people currently don’t get enough support from their companies. But as employers start to see proven results from some of their solutions, other managers will follow their trends.

#timetowork #motivationalspeech #disciplinedthinking 
The morning sun begins to rise,
A new day dawns before our eyes.
With purpose clear and spirits high,
It's time to work, let's reach the sky.

No more delay, no more excuse,
For dreams won't come if we refuse.
With sleeves rolled up, we take a stance,
Ready to seize each precious chance.

The task at hand may seem immense,
But with determination, we commence.
Step by step, we make our way,
Building success, day by day.

Through challenges and obstacles we'll face,
We won't falter, we'll keep the pace.
With focus sharp and minds engaged,
We'll conquer all, unswayed by rage.

Time ticks on, the minutes pass,
We won't let it slip through like sand in a glass.
Efficiency and diligence guide our hand,
As we strive to leave our mark on this land.

With passion burning deep within,
We'll push beyond where others begin.
No clock can hold us, no limit can bind,
For it's time to work, and greatness we'll find.

So let us rise, embrace the call,
Together we'll stand, we'll give our all.
The world awaits the fruits we'll sow,
It's time to work, let's make it show.

It's all about deciphering the emotion and motivations underlying the data. You must be able to clearly communicate a message as well as listen in such a way that you grasp the entire meaning of what is being said and make the other person feel heard and understood.

Effective communication appears to be a natural instinct. But, all too frequently, something goes wrong when we try to communicate with others. We say one thing, but the other person hears something completely different, resulting in misunderstandings, dissatisfaction, and conflict. This can cause issues in your relationships at home, school, and at work.

Script:

In case you hadn’t noticed, life is difficult, complex and unpredictable. You can’t change this. It’s the nature of things. But you can prepare yourself for the next unwelcome surprise. 

How? By building resilience.

Resilience is the ability to bounce back from life’s inevitable disappointments, failures, and pains.

Let me use an analogy here. 

If cars didn’t have shock absorbers, every ride would be a miserable experience. The ride through life without shock absorbers – that is, resilience – would be the same. So, without building resilience – your own internal shock absorbers – it’s not possible to lead a happy and productive life. 

Resilience is the opposite of fragility. To be fragile means that just about everything upsets you. And if just about everything upsets you, you will spend a lot of time angry and hurt. And if you spend a lot of time angry and hurt, you will not be a happy person.
 
Here, I’m not focusing on severe illness, the death of a loved one or any crushing life-changing event. In such cases, people usually need help to recover. But for most of us, such situations are rare – while the slights and disappointments of ordinary life are not. And for those, we need resilience.
 
OK, then. How do you develop resilience? Here are some suggestions to get you started, drawn from my forty-plus years as a psychiatrist. 

First, get some perspective. 

Step back and assess your situation with as much objectivity as you can. “How bad is this problem?” “Have I overstated it?” 

Sometimes my patients think an unhappy occurrence is much more serious than it really is – usually because it’s amplified by evoking a painful childhood issue. Often getting perspective is as simple as asking yourself this question: “What’s the worst thing that can happen?” Usually you’ll discover the worst thing isn’t that bad – and isn’t even likely to happen. 

Second, compare the undeserved bad things that have happened to you with the unearned good things that have happened to you. 

When I ask my patients to do this, they invariably conclude that the unearned good in their life far outweighs the undeserved bad. I’d say the ratio is at least 10 to 1. In my own case, I didn’t earn the incredibly good fortune of my grandparents moving to America, or that life-saving penicillin was available to me in my childhood when I was sick. I could go on and on. And so could you. 

In light of this, maybe things aren’t so bad after all. In fact, they’re probably pretty good. 

Third, toughen up. 

Life hits you from all directions – health, personal relationships, work challenges, family issues. To deal with them, you need to build up your mental toughness. The earlier in life one starts this process, the better. 

That’s why parents who coddle their children and protect them from every hurt and failure are not doing them any favors. Nor are colleges that provide students with so-called “safe spaces.” To toughen up, you need to push yourself. How do you know what you’re capable of if you don’t do that?

I quit ""my dream job"" as an actor and have been so much happier since. If you have ever wondered ""Should i quit my job"", ""Is it worth a paycut"" or ""What will people say about me""...I have lots of thoughts to share with you.

I wanted to make this video because I find myself having this conversation with so many friends, family members and even strangers -- The Great Resignation is among us. Something is in the air, and if you are miserable in your work or in your life...there is another way. 

Change is hard. But slowly and imperceptibly, things do change. And they can change for the better. 

I think I'll be doing videos in the future going into greater depth on how I got into each of these individual careers. So leave any questions you have in the comments and I'll cover more in a future video!

Thanks for indulging 40 straight minutes of me yelling. 
Lots of love,

To set and achieve your YouTube goals, you'll need to define your purpose, understand your audience, create content that resonates with them, and optimize your channel for search and discovery. You'll also need to analyze your performance regularly, adjust your strategy as needed, and stay up to date with the latest trends and best practices.

Remember, achieving your goals takes time, effort, and patience, but the results can be well worth it.

Welcome to Meditation Music by Sacred Spirit
🎼 Mindfulness music helps tune our physiology, reducing the throbbing pulse and heart rate, reducing blood pressure and stress levels. It can provide a remarkable sense of relaxation. 

🎹 ℍ𝕠𝕨 𝕥𝕠 𝕘𝕖𝕥 𝕒𝕟 𝕒𝕓𝕤𝕠𝕝𝕦𝕥𝕖 𝕖𝕩𝕡𝕖𝕣𝕚𝕖𝕟𝕔𝕖 𝕝𝕚𝕤𝕥𝕖𝕟𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕥𝕠 𝕥𝕙𝕖 𝕞𝕦𝕤𝕚𝕔. 
Relax every muscle in your body and face. Take deep breaths and try staying calm as much as you can. Try to tame your mind from distractions. As you breathe deeply in, expand your belly and move your chest to fill your lungs. Take a deep breath through your mouth and slowly exhale. All the while staying focused on the music. 

🧘🏻‍♂️🧘🏻‍♀️🧘🏿🧘🏾‍♀️ 
Early morning Mind Rejuvenation yoga novices, meditation techniques, spiritual incantations that incorporate soothing string and wind instruments, and comforting music that can help you undergo a spiritual experience will benefit from our peaceful tunes. The objective of our effective tunes is to assist and improve relaxation, meditation, creativity, and attention.

 🪐 
Binaural beats and music tuned at a specific frequency are also used to restore a state of rest, which is great for meditation, deep sleep, and concentration. We provide a more satisfying experience for sleeplessness or insomnia through music. We provide soothing sleeping music for deep relaxation through the use of delta waves and mellow instrumental tunes. Our music is especially suitable for meditation, relaxation, and sleep music. Listen to it on headphones while you work, study, or as soothing background music. It is ideal for sleep and relaxation. As well as music for zen, it also acts as music for healing in the morning.

If we have any items in our home that someone said, “These need to stay in the family,” but we know we don’t want them in our home, we’re going to have a negative feeling towards that relative.

And it might not be extreme; it might just be such subtle resentment…
“I have to keep these dishes. I have to keep this furniture.”

But that negatively impacts our emotional well-being.

By developing genuine gratitude for others, Joseph believes we can all react more positively to fear in any form.
 
Joseph Lewis is a law enforcement officer for DC Metro, a community advocate for the Lutheran Immigration Refugee Service, a seminary student, and a former refugee. Born in Liberia, he lived a normal life up until 1989, when a civil war broke out in the area. After facing multiple setbacks for the remainder of his childhood and the beginning of his adult life, Joseph migrated to the United States where he settled into a life of homelessness. Encouragement from those in his local community inspired Joseph to go to college and earn a degree. Through his experiences, Joseph has become a key community figure and source of inspiration, actively telling his story and encouraging others to do the same.

According to Medscape's 2019 survey of more than 15,000 physicians in over 29 specialties, 44% of physicians reported feeling burned out; 11% were colloquially depressed and 4% were clinically depressed.  Among the most burned out specialties were critical care (48%) and neurology (48%), closely followed by family medicine (47%), ob/gyn (46%), and internal medicine (46%). At USF Health, to balance out what may feel like repetitive, meaningless activity, physicians are encouraged to do research, teach, or consult. ""There's a huge array of techniques that we use to avoid burnout,"" says John T. Sinnott, chairman of USF Health's Department of Internal Medicine. ""We encourage international travel with our doctors; we encourage volunteer work. Burnout is a dangerous problem and we pay attention to it.""

Mental exhaustion can happen when your brain receives too much stimulation or has to maintain an intense level of activity without rest.

Work or study for long hours with few or no breaks, spend a lot of time with overwhelming tasks, devote a lot time thinking through problems, worries, or other sources of stress are some common causes of mental fatigue. With balance diet and consuming anti-fatigue foods like Chicken Essence, fruits and leafy vegetables helps battle mental fatigue.

Depersonalization and burnout,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOx0dEoaDrQ,How to Deal with Dissociation as a Reaction to Trauma,Dr. Tracey Marks,unknown,"202824","10750",0,"864","Dissociation is an experience where your attention and emotions are disconnected from the present moment. It’s like you’re here, but your mind and emotions are somewhere else.  This is a general term and experience. I talked in a previous video about depersonalization and derealization. Those are specific kinds of dissociative experiences. With depersonalization you feel detached or disconnected from yourself so you may feel like you’re observing yourself. With derealization, you feel disconnected from your environment. You may feel like the room you’re in isn’t real or that you’re in a different place than you really are.

An example of this is experiencing a car accident where you smelled the burning rubber of your tires. Then whenever you are riding in a car you think you smell the rubber again.

That is an example of a dissociative experience you can have after the trauma experience. But sometimes you can dissociate during a traumatic event. This can be your mind’s way of protecting you from a situation where there is no escape.

This is pretty common during physical or sexual trauma when you can’t get away. In order to endure the assault, you brain turns down your response to pain and numbs your emotional response. In your mind you may go to another place such that it feels like it’s really not happening to you.  

During the traumatic experience, that kind of reaction helps you survive it. But then sometimes dissociation becomes a built in defense mechanism that you employ in other situations that are unrelated to trauma. 

For example, you can be triggered to feel disconnected or numb in response to something that reminded you of the trauma, even if you weren’t consciously aware of the trigger. You can just feel empty all the time and not know why.


Smells and sounds can remind you of the trauma in a way that your body responds with anxiety and fear, but you don’t always put it together why you’re feeling anxious. It’s like the fragmented memories can come flooding back in response to sights, sounds and touch. 

Anxiety is another trigger that can send you into a dissociative state. So let’s say you are under a lot of stress at work. You can have trouble relating to people at work because with the added stress, you start zoning out at work. Or you start withdrawing from people because you feel like you’re a stranger and your coworkers make you feel uncomfortable. 

What can you do about this? The best treatments are trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy, prolonged exposure, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing.

One self-help approach is to use grounding techniques.
Grounding techniques bring your awareness back to the present moment  where you ARE safe.  It’s like getting your bearing and refocusing. You can use sensory grounding or cognitive grounding. Sensory grounding uses the five senses to bring you back to the present moment and cognitive grounding uses your thoughts to remind yourself that you ARE in a safe place. 

Sensory grounding exercises:
The 5-4-3-2-1 sensory exercise. 
Use a grounding smell that can bring your attention back to the present. 
Carry a sensory grounding object in your pocket. 
Splash cold water on your face and neck. 

Cognitive grounding exercises:
Show yourself that you’re safe. 
Orient yourself to time and place. 
Repeat an inspiring quote or saying that’s comforting to you. 
Say coping statements like I can handle this, my situation is so much better now, these feelings with pass, etc.

Interpersonal detachment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grcr4f3a-XA,FIVE Ways to Fix Emotional Detachment,Beyond Blue,unknown,"5188","119",0,"5","FIVE Ways to Fix Emotional Detachment

Emotional detachment, like most disorders and emotional trauma, usually comes with the will to seek help. Most times, it represents an element of an illness or other severe personality disorders. It is quite ironic that a person who is emotionally unavailable to people around and prefers to go through personal issues without others' involvement will seek help. Still, it is essential to remember that people suffering from Emotional detachments have underlying problems or causal effects and are not in absolute control of their desolation. To fix a problem, you have to consider the causes, and in the case of emotional detachments, there are series of underlying effects that could develop into the emotional disorder.

Some causes of Emotional detachment and their possible fixes include:

Emotional detachment due to underlying mental illness.

I’m Emma McAdam. I’m a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, and I have worked in various settings of change and growth since 2004. My experience includes juvenile corrections, adventure therapy programs, wilderness therapy programs, an eating disorder treatment center, a residential treatment center, and I currently work in an outpatient therapy clinic.  

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction. 
And deeper than all of that, the Gospel of Jesus Christ orients my personal worldview and sense of security, peace, hope, and love https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe

FURTHER READING

“Our assessment of politicians is torn between hope and disappointment. On the one hand, we have an idealistic idea that a politician should be an upright hero, a man or woman who can breathe new moral life into the corrupt workings of the state. However, we are also regularly catapulted into cynicism when we realise the number of backroom deals and the extent of the lying that politicians go in for. We seem torn between our idealistic hopes and our pessimistic fears about the evil underbelly of politics...”

There is!! You’ve got to try this!
It’s a super simple communication hack that has a HUGE impact on how others feel when they’re around you, and can have a massively positive impact on your relationships (both professional and personal!). 

Here’s why: 

The word ‘BUT’ becomes a form of psychological invalidation. It rejects, dismisses or minimises someone else's thoughts or feelings.

“I’m so sorry you feel that way, BUT…”
“That’s a great idea, BUT…”
“You’re a great team member, BUT…”

Instead, swap it for another three-letter word, and trust me - you’ll notice the difference!

In detachment lies the wisdom of uncertainty.... in the wisdom of uncertainty lies the freedom from our past, from the known, which is the prison of past conditioning. When we are willing to step into the unknown, possibilites and opportunities are endless and we can surrender ourselves to the creative mind that orchestrates the dance of the universe (chopra.com).

He has made numerous significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function and neural plasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to rewire and learn new behaviors, skills and cognitive functioning. 

Huberman is a McKnight Foundation and Pew Foundation Fellow and was awarded the Cogan Award in 2017, given to the scientist making the most significant discoveries in the study of vision. His lab’s most recent work focuses on the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. He also works on neural regeneration and directs a clinical trial to promote visual restoration in diseases that cause blindness. Huberman is also actively involved in developing tools now in use by the elite military in the U.S. and Canada, athletes, and technology industries to optimize performance in high stress environments, enhance neural plasticity, mitigate stress, and optimize sleep. 

Work from the Huberman Laboratory at Stanford School of Medicine has been published in top journals including Nature, Science, and Cell and has been featured in TIME, BBC, Scientific American, Discover, and other top media outlets.

In 2021, Dr. Huberman launched the Huberman Lab Podcast. The podcast is frequently ranked in the Top 25 of all podcasts globally and is often ranked #1 in the categories of Science, Education, and Health & Fitness.

Speaking is not merely a matter of using words, but it needs a more complicated process of producing speech. Speaking is a productive skill that needs a lot of practices. In addition to listening, speaking is mostly taught to the people before reading and writing. By using spoken English, people will be able to convey their idea. Therefore, speaking is a direct route from one mind to another and is the best way to ask a question or give an explanation

Fluency is the use of naturally occurring language when a speaker engages and maintains in meaningful communication. This communication would be comprehensible and ongoing in spite of limitations in one’s communicative competence.

I focus on the science of how early infant-caregiver attachment, combined with adolescence and puberty shapes our adult patterns of attachment. I explain the three universal aspects of emotions, the reality of right-brain versus left-brain personalities, and how the roots of adult attachment are also grounded in specific aspects of puberty. I review what factors determine when puberty starts and ends, and the role of oxytocin and other chemicals in controlling how we perceive and remember others. As always, I refer to various practical tools including new tools for understanding and predicting our emotions before they occur, and neurochemicals that shape human connection.

Professional growth and development,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hln9ewMMS34,"professional development goals steps and examples ,what are professional growth goals",TOP CAREERS CHANNEL,unknown,"638","3",0,"0","Professional Development Goals: Steps and Examples, what are professional growth goals.

Understanding professional development goals
Setting goals for professional development is an important part of advancing your career. Whether your goals are to be more productive at work or become the CEO of a corporation, the only way to get there is by setting actionable goals you can work on every day. Here we explore what professional development goals are, why they are important, steps you can take to set this type of goal, and several examples to give you ideas when creating your own professional goals.

What are professional development goals?
Professional goals are goals you set that are focused on improving your career and increasing your competencies and capabilities in the workplace. There are several development goals you can set to further your workplace success, and the exact goals you set should be dependent on your unique aspirations in terms of career. Goals can be related to learning new skills, obtaining new degrees or certifications, getting more experience in a certain area, moving up in your workplace, and aiming for any other aspirations related to advancing your career.

Why are professional development goals important?
Setting professional development goals are important for several reasons, including that they.

Give you an idea of your vision for your future: Many people know what they want to do in the next year, but do you know what your long-term career goals are? Where do you want to be in five or even 10 years? Establishing goals allows you to identify your long-term aspirations and begin to take action in reaching those aspirations.
Help you hone existing workplace skills: Even if you're great at what you do, there is always room for improvement or advancement. The greatest athletes don't simply rest on their laurels and use their current level of fitness to ride out their success. Rather, they regularly practice to get stronger and faster. The same is true in the workplace—working on honing your current skills allows you to get better and grow in new and different ways, which can ultimately make you a better employee and even more successful in your career.
Encourage you to become a better employee: Employers highly value employees who are dedicated to their jobs and the advancement of their careers. Rather than simply showing up to work and completing your duties for the day, taking time to get better at what you do will make a positive impression on your employer and could even open the door to advancement within your organization.
Improve productivity: Have a goal to work towards can provide a steady stream of motivation and boost your productivity in the workplace. This is especially true when you separate your goals into individual tasks and work to complete a task each day or week. Making progress, even when it's small, can keep you motivated to push through and get the job done.
How to set professional development goals.
The following are steps you can take when setting goals for your professional development.

Decide what your end goal is. A good way to set goals for your professional development is to start with the end goal in mind. Where do you want to be in five or 10 years? What job title do you want to have? What company or industry do you want to work in? What accomplishments do you want to achieve? Knowing your end goal will allow you to work backward to create smaller goals that allow you to ultimately reach your larger professional goals.
When in doubt, reference your most recent performance review. If you aren't sure where to start or what areas you should work on professionally, take a look at your most recent performance evaluation and see what your manager or employer recommended you improve upon. For example, maybe one improvement your manager noted was to complete more tasks on time. This gives you a solid foundation on which to build a professional goal and also ensures your making the desired improvements as requested by management.

Interpersonal detachment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqGxnyjQO7M,The Secret to Detachment with the Law of Attraction (3 Ways To Detach from Outcome),Aaron Doughty,unknown,"332727","11573",0,"385","""Welcome back to another video. My name is Aaron, and I help people expand their consciousness. Now on this video I will be sharing with you the secret to detachment in order to attract what you want in your life. With this process of the paradox of detaching from your desires, it's about really understanding that the power exists within you to feel the emotions of having whatever you desire to have.
""
""Now I recently did a video that was called ""A process more powerful than the law of attraction."" It still uses the principles but it redirects it into a process that can allow us to feel the emotions that we prefer right now as if we already have whatever we want to bring outside of ourselves and bring into here. That's kind of the inside out analogy of it, but really we have the ability to feel whatever emotion we want right now in this moment. When we start to train ourselves to do this, that's when we will really start to then see the reflection in our life.
""
""Now the reason I mention all that is because, when comes to detachment, it's important to understand why it is so important to let go of the outcome and to allow it to happen in the past of least resistance. This is about knowing this concept.
""
""Now first off, there are two main reasons that detachment is so powerful. Because when you detach from something having to happen or a certain way that you want it to happen, when you detach from that perspective and you let it go, what you then beginning to do is you stop limiting yourself from the different ways that it could be brought into your life.
""
""For example, if it comes to bringing more abundance in your life or even a certain person like a relationship, what happens is if there's a certain blueprint for the way that you want it to happen, that blueprint, if anything else comes into your experience, any other opportunity and you don't recognize it, what you will automatically do is discount it and you won't take action on that opportunity.
""
""The power of this is knowing that as we simply allow it to happen in the best way possible and we have no attachment to how it happens, we are then trusting the process and we are allowing those dominoes to fall into place. We're allowing the things to happen in the best way possible.
""
""Now the second reason detachment is so powerful is because when we detach from the outcome, we then let go of the resistance that tends to build up inside of our body. Because if we walk around attached to it and things aren't happening the exact way that we want, we then start to feel the resistance of it. That resistance will literally block the opportunities from coming into our life. Because, as I always say, we don't necessarily attract that which we want but we always get a reflection of who we are being.
""
""If we are being somebody and feeling the emotions of that lack of not having what we want, we will continue to see a reflection in our life of that not coming to us or the opposite of it. Those are the main two reasons that it's so powerful to detach from the outcome.
""
""Now I want to give you three ways that we can apply in our life to allow us to take this into a much more powerful way. The first one has to do with the very beginning of your day. This is something that I do. I do a meditation for 20 minutes right when I wake up.
""
""The first, I'd say, about 10 minutes of that meditation is me just breathing and observing my breath, allowing myself to become very present. I like to bring the awareness out of thinking and into my body. That allows me not to think so much.
""
""Then what I do is after about 10 minutes of it, what I do is I shift my focus over to what I want to experience. You could call this segment intending, but what I do is I focus on the intentions of what I want to do that day or what I want to experience. As I focus on that, I'll focus on the emotions that I would feel. I focus on what are called submodalities.
""
""A submodality is the different sensory input that we would use for it. Some people are very visual. Some people hear; they're very auditory. Some people feel very visceral. Pick a combination of those or just a couple of those and allow yourself to really embody the emotions of it. Do that for 10 or 15 minutes.
""
""Now, at the end of those 10 or 15 minutes of doing it, simply decide you are going to let it go, you have done what you need to do for the day, and then simply trust that things will begin to ...

Long hours and intolerable demands from superiors also add to job-related stress. Managers must avoid overwhelming their workers with responsibilities that go above and beyond the scope of what companies hired them for. Another cause of employee burnout is not giving clear expectations to each worker. How Employee Burnout Affects the Overall Company Performance.

As more and more workers switch between jobs, there will be an escalation in your employee turnover rate. Most people don't know that their employee is burned-out until too late. They do not work hard, do not commit to your business's goals, exert less effort, and don't value the company's success.

I did my best to discuss topics and ask questions she has not talked about before to uncover more of the nuance behind these tricky subjects. We extend the conversation to how we can facilitate the growth and development of the younger generations through critical thinking, parenting strategies, education, looking through history and carefully selected books to foster child development. If you're a parent or want to have children one day I hope you enjoy this conversation and it shines a new perspective on these topics for you.

The reason might be because you’re confusing satisfaction and happiness, with fulfillment. You might feel work satisfaction and experience happy times but yet feel that there’s something lacking. I’ll talk about a few reasons that you might feel unfulfilled in your career.

I hope this episode is useful to you, and don’t forget to drop your questions in the comment section below!

Stress reduction and burnout,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXA330433uI,"""Performing Under Pressure"" – stress reduction and burnout prevention e-training by Wellness Orbit",Wellness Orbit by Conscious Initiative PLC,unknown,"1120","7",0,"0","https://www.wellnessorbit.com – The world's first fully digital Mental Wellness Gym for teams presents a very efficient way of reducing the stress and burnout at work for all employees.
______

Why you need it? 

Work and life changes at a ridiculous speed. We need radically new skills to handle our own inner reactivity towards constant changes and information overload if we want to avoid exhaustion burnout. And yet, it is a very common problem as according to Cigna 360 Well-being from 2019: “91% agree that colleagues’ stress impacts the workplace with a higher degree of negative impacts such as a depressing atmosphere and lowering morale, and yet employers are not doing enough to address the issue.” 

The same Cigna Report stated: “In the workplace, 87% of workers are stressed, with 12% claiming it as unmanageable”. It is indeed likely that the latter faced severe burnout or mental health issues. But it doesn’t need to be this way. All it takes is to learn to read the early warning signs as burnout has several phases and never takes place overnight. 

There is no need to suffer from pressure, stress or burnout as practical intrapersonal skills help us to prevent and nip mental health issues in the bud. This e-training brings forward a radically new approach to employee mental fitness and is for all of your team members, especially for those who still feel well and are your well-performing players.

The stress reduction and burnout prevention training practice ""Performing Under Pressure"" consists of 5 ca 45-minute video sessions developed and presented by the mental wellness expert Dr. Helena Lass:

► Session 1: Focus, Awareness & Attention;

► Session 2: Making Most of Time & Resources;

► Session 3: A New Way to Handle Stress;

► Session 4: Prevent Burnout & Fatigue;

► Session 5: Personal Responsibility & Teamwork.

Your fully digital Mental Wellness Gym training is much more than just videos. The training starts and ends with self-evaluation of stress & burnout risk (with instant feedback) for all trainees.

Your team training also includes workbook (with group discussion guidelines), quiz, promo materials for your team, etc.

The standard training period is 3 months but custom training periods and annual memberships are also available. 

The total training time with quiz and self-evaluation tests before and after the training is between 6 to 8 hours per team member. 

Availability: Now, everywhere where there is an Internet connection. 

This mental wellness online training is innovative (face-to-face feeling, quiz) and easy to set up. See detailed agenda, testimonials and find your Free Mini Training option: https://www.wellnessorbit.com/trainings/training-practice-1-performing-under-pressure/training-practices/id/18

Just apply these tips in your day-to-day interactions. Whether you want to have better conversations in your personal and social life, or get your ideas across better at work, you can learn how to communicate more effectively. It’s one of the most important life skills you can have.

There are many ways to have a better communication. For example, asking questions will not only help you understand what the other person is saying, it also indicates that you're actually interested in what they’re saying. And if you want to show that you really understand, then paraphrasing is one of the simplest communication techniques you can use.

The more you pay attention to how you express yourself to others, the more you will improve your communication skills. So give it a try!

Some of our actions may be too mentally draining, such as holding onto toxic relationships or pushing ourselves too hard with school or work. It can be a good idea to step back and take a look at our behaviors and habits and ask ourselves the question: do I possess healthy habits? Or negative ones? I’m sure we all have negative habits, but now it’s time to start incorporating some mentally beneficial behaviors into our routines in hopes we can develop a new habit - a good one this time. Here are a few mental health tips that boost your emotional well-being.

When we experience stress–or any threat to our well-being–our brain goes on high alert, activating an ancient system designed to protect us from a wide variety of threats and dangers. Unfortunately, modern life is keeping most of us in a state of chronic stress activation. This puts our bodies in an ongoing state of survival mode and sets the stage for burnout, fatigue, and adrenal dysfunction.

Today on The Doctor’s Farmacy, I talk with Izabella Wentz all about adrenal dysfunction, how it develops, its common signs and symptoms, and how to support your adrenal function to reverse burnout.

---TRANSCRIPT---
Thanks for stopping by, this is 2 Minute Classroom and today we are talking about setting goals using the SMART method. 

Goal setting is a great activity anytime but is especially popular around New Years', at the start of the school year, and the beginning of a sports season. I would love to hear some of your goals in the comments and I’ll put some of mine in the description below. 
 
SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

We’ll go through each of these using the example goal of “doing well on your next exam” - A common goal for students.

The first step is to make the goal specific. “Doing well on your next exam” is not specific. Try to answer the questions of what, when, and why.

Let’s specify your what as scoring at least 90% on your next science exam.

For the when it will be whenever the exam is, let’s say it’s in 4 weeks.

The why is very important as this is your motivation for the goal and something you can look back on if you get discouraged. 

It could be to improve your grade in the course, to score higher than a friend, or because you want to get into a great university. Whatever will motivate you to keep working on the goal. 

So now we have a much more specific goal “Score at least 90% on the next science exam four weeks from now to help you get into a great university.” 

This goal is looking great, but we are not done yet. 

The next step is to make sure the goal is measurable. That means there are some metrics attached to the goal to let you know if you reach your goal or not. 

Looking back at our goal we see that it is to score at least 90%. This is very measurable and once you’ve taken the test and received a score you will know whether or not you hit the goal. 

This is also why “Doing well on your next exam” is a poor goal - it is not measurable and there is no clear way to define success or failure. 

The next step is to check whether the goal is achievable or not. In this step you want to break the goal down and answer the question of “how” you will achieve this goal. What do you need to do in the next four weeks to get at least 90% on the exam. 

Some examples may include taking notes in class, spending 30 minutes three nights per week studying for the exam, and partnering with a friend a week before the exam to review notes and go through a study guide. 

The point is you need a plan. Break the goal down into smaller goals that all feed up to the main goal. This will give you a clear path to success.

The fourth step is to ensure the goal is relevant. 

This step is more of a gut check to see if it fits well in your life right now. Ask yourself the following questions: Does this align with my long-term objectives? Does it keep me on track for other goals in your life? Will focusing on this goal pull me away from other, more important goals?

After thinking through this step you should feel confident your goal is relevant and be even more motivated to achieve it. 

Scoring at least 90% on your next science exam is relevant because it will give you confidence in school and feed into larger goals around future education and career. 

The last step is to make the goal time-bound. 

A time-bound deadline acts as a target and helps you work backward and set smaller steps to get there. If you set a fitness goal to be able to do 100 consecutive pushups but don’t set a deadline to reach that goal then it probably won't happen.

Hitting a certain score on an exam is time-bound by default because there is a specific date for the exam which allows us to break the goal into smaller steps leading up to the exam. 

And here is a bonus tip. If you truly want to reach your goals then you have to write them down and look at them often. I recommend keeping a daily/weekly planner to track your progress. I’ve put some excellent planner recommendations in the description that will help make your goals a reality. 

Remember to share your goals in the comments, I will read and respond to as many of them as I can.

As relationship researcher Logan Ury explains, you can choose to TURN TOWARDS your partner in these moments and accept their bids to connect, or TURN AWAY and ignore their bids. Every time you choose to turn towards, you make a deposit in your Emotional Bank Account.  

Notice when your partner makes a bid. Show interest, ask questions, nod, listen, and put away your screens.

Intro:
Welcome to our channel! In this video, we're going to talk about career development and job satisfaction. Your career is a big part of your life, and it's important to feel fulfilled and satisfied with the work you do. In this video, we'll share with you some tips and strategies that can help you develop your career and achieve job satisfaction.

Body:

Set goals: Setting career goals is an important first step in career development. These goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). By setting goals, you can focus your efforts and track your progress.

Develop skills: Developing new skills and improving existing ones is key to career development. This can be achieved through education, training, and on-the-job experience. Take advantage of opportunities to learn and grow in your career.

Seek mentorship: Finding a mentor can be a great way to gain guidance and advice from someone who has more experience in your field. A mentor can help you develop your skills, navigate challenges, and provide career advice.

Network: Networking is an important part of career development. Attend industry events, join professional organizations, and connect with colleagues on LinkedIn. Building relationships can lead to new opportunities and help you stay informed about trends and developments in your field.

Seek feedback: Asking for feedback from colleagues and supervisors can help you identify areas for improvement and track your progress. This can also help you develop new skills and demonstrate your value to your employer.

Pursue a passion: If you're not satisfied with your current job, consider pursuing a passion or interest that aligns with your career goals. This can lead to a more fulfilling career and a greater sense of purpose.

Find work-life balance: Achieving work-life balance is important for job satisfaction. Make time for hobbies, family, and other interests outside of work. This can help you feel more fulfilled and refreshed when you return to work.

Advocate for yourself: Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself in your career. Negotiate for fair pay and benefits, ask for promotions or additional responsibilities, and speak up about your goals and aspirations.

Examples:
Let's say you're a marketing professional who wants to advance your career. You can apply the tips above to help achieve your goals. First, set SMART goals, such as completing a certification or taking on a leadership role in your department. Second, develop new skills by attending conferences or taking online courses. Third, seek mentorship from a senior colleague who has experience in your field. Fourth, network by attending industry events or joining a professional organization. Fifth, seek feedback from your supervisor or colleagues to identify areas for improvement. Sixth, pursue a passion or interest, such as social media or content marketing. Seventh, find work-life balance by prioritizing hobbies and interests outside of work. Eighth, advocate for yourself by asking for promotions or additional responsibilities.

Conclusion:
Developing your career and achieving job satisfaction requires effort and dedication. By setting goals, developing skills, seeking mentorship, networking, seeking feedback, pursuing passions, finding work-life balance, and advocating for yourself, you can create a fulfilling career that aligns with your goals and values.

WHAT IS STRESS:
Stress is something everyone feels at times, and there are all kinds of stressful situations that can be a part of daily life. Low-level stress can even be helpful or motivational.

There are plenty of things you can do to help cope with stressful events, and simple steps you can take to deal with feelings of stress or burnout.

Stress is the body's reaction to feeling threatened or under pressure. It's very common, can be motivating to help us achieve things in our daily life, and can help us meet the demands of home, work and family life.

But too much stress can affect our mood, our body and our relationships – especially when it feels out of our control. It can make us feel anxious and irritable, and affect our self-esteem.

Experiencing a lot of stress over a long period of time can also lead to a feeling of physical, mental and emotional exhaustion, often called burnout.

Stress can cause many different symptoms. It might affect how you feel physically, mentally and also how you behave.

It's not always easy to recognise when stress is the reason you're feeling or acting differently.

Physical symptoms:
• Headaches or dizziness
• Muscle tension or pain
• Stomach problems
• Chest pain or a faster heartbeat
• Sexual problems

Mental symptoms:
• Difficulty concentrating
• Struggling to make decisions
• Feeling overwhelmed
• Constantly worrying
• Being forgetful

Changes in behaviour:
• Being irritable and snappy
• Sleeping too much or too little
• Eating too much or too little
• Avoiding certain places or people
• Drinking or smoking more

NHS self assessment tool for stress: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/

POSSIBLE CAUSES OF STRESS:
Stress affects people differently, and the things that cause stress vary from person to person.

The level of stress you are comfortable with may be higher or lower than that of other people around you. Stressful feelings typically happen when we feel we do not have the resources to manage the challenges we face.

Pressure at work, school or home, illness, or difficult or sudden life events can all lead to stress.

Some possible causes of stress are:
• Our individual genes, upbringing and experiences
• Difficulties in our personal lives and relationships
• Big or unexpected life changes, like moving house, having a baby or starting to care for someone
• Money difficulties, like debt or struggling to afford daily essentials
• Health issues, either for you or someone close to you
• Pregnancy and children
• Problems with housing, like the conditions, maintenance or tenancy
• A difficult or troubled work environment

WHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL ADVICE:
• You're struggling to cope with stress
• Things you're trying yourself are not helping
• You would prefer to get a referral from a GP

Referring yourself for therapy
If you need more support, you can get free psychological therapies like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the NHS. You can refer yourself directly to an NHS psychological therapies service (IAPT) without a referral from a GP - https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/

Please seek emergency medical help if,
• You or someone you know needs immediate help
• You have seriously harmed yourself – for example, by taking a drug overdose
A mental health emergency should be taken as seriously as a medical emergency.

Professional detachment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHkJjWlZhK4,The Power of NOT Reacting - How To Control Your Emotions,BRAINY DOSE,unknown,"609115","21652",0,"485","Here's how to stop overreacting and how to control your emotions in the moment! The power of not reacting means leaving space to respond instead of reacting emotionally during a difficult conversation or situation. It's important to learn some self control techniques so that impulsive behavior doesn't get out of hand! This is where a little bit of psychology comes in handy!

Self control is a skill that's useful for all areas of your life, including interpersonal relationships. If you're able to stay calm and collected even when someone else triggers you, then you'll be able to better communicate and resolve conflicts more quickly. And that's just one way this skill can help you out!

If you feel like your emotions control you and you're always reacting to things and never get a chance to think about what's going on, then you need to learn how to control your reactivity. This video will teach you how to stop overreacting and stay calm when triggered emotionally, so you can start responding rationally instead.

I guarantee, that this will be the best motivational video that you will see today, It’s not like the “Fake” motivational videos out there on YouTube. It’s literally impossible, to not be motivated if you implement this habit. 

We all struggle with motivation from time to time, it’s not bad to admit this. But it is bad, to allow yourself to stay unmotivated. There are many people who talk about motivation, as if it’s something that you get. But we have to realize, that motivation is just an emotion, and all emotions are transient, meaning they come and they go. So, you can rely on motivation, because it comes and it goes. Implementing this strategy will also force you to be self disciplined, because you really do have no other option.

Interpersonal detachment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiMW4dong-Y,What Is Emotional Detachment?  | BetterHelp,BetterHelp,unknown,"34758","765",0,"24","Content/Trigger Warning: Please be advised, this video might mention trauma-related topics which could potentially be triggering.

If you or someone you know is dealing with a challenging situation and could benefit from additional support, consider talking to one of the 20,000 licensed therapists at https://www.betterhelp.com/get-started/?utm_source=organicyoutube&utm_campaign=kamran&utm_term=emotional_detachment 

Emotional detachment is a condition where people struggle with forming emotional attachments. Dissociation can include mild emotional detachment from immediate surroundings to more severe cases of psychologically disconnecting from the present moment which is often associated with trauma.  

When someone is experiencing emotional detachment, they may feel as if they’re unable to express emotions. Emotional numbness can often lead to treating others disrespectfully, and people who struggle with emotional detachment are unaware that they are being perceived as rude. Those with emotional detachment issues might avoid emotions even when a situation calls for an emotional response. 

They may struggle to empathize with other people’s emotions and they often can’t even identify their own emotions. This condition will usually be temporary, but some will have ongoing issues with it. Often, therapy will be able to help people to work on things so that they can form emotional attachments again.

When the demand to perform, overwhelms your motivation/resources to deal with it, burnout is inevitable. 
What is burnout? It is a period of complete exhaustion and disinterest in things, resulting in a general decline in health 
or physical performance.
You probably may have experienced burnout yourself, or have seen someone experiencing it, maybe while grappling with a new job, 
when a new baby arrives, or after intense studying during exams. However, emotional burnout is not just a phase that passes with time. 
If left unchecked, it could lead to psychological issues. Severe burnout conditions can make a person become a shadow of his former self. 
A person becomes drained, physically, emotionally, and mentally. Lacks happiness, is cynical, depressed, and lack the motivation to do anything.
 Burnout doesn't just show up at once; it takes a gradual process, and usually, one experiences mild symptoms like tiredness, body ache, 
 and exhaustion. When it becomes full-blown, you see signs like depression, apathy, and cynicism. 
 
The good thing is if you know what to look out for, you can recognize burnout and address it before it becomes too late. 
Find out some 8 Obvious signs that anyone experiencing and emotional burnout will show.

Mettaverse music is creating healing music and soundscapes for all walks of life. Sound is soul, it calls you to remember your natural state: one of peace, relaxation, better sleep, creative flow, focus, and inner peace.

Metta-verse is a vision of reality directly connected to the heart and soul of what makes us human beings, what brings us all together. ""Metta"" is a term in Pāli meaning unconditional loving kindness, a love directly from the cosmic spark deep inside your soul. Mettaverse started as a vision of one man, using music as a universal language, simply to bring people together. Resonating as one heart, as one love. Always, here and now.

May this music bring you peace, healing, and happiness. 💜

So much of your energy goes into coping with the treatment and coming out the other side, that once you do you are left facing 'normal' life again. This can also be a difficult transition and you'll be facing new emotional challenges.

Today I talk about how you can improve your emotional well-being after breast cancer.  Around 60% of breast cancer survivors suffer from PTSD and anxiety in the year following their treatment. What happens to our brains during the recovery from a traumatic event?

WORRIED ABOUT A BREAST LUMP OR SYMPTOM?
FRUSTRATED AND CONFUSED BY CONFLICTING INFORMATION?
TRYING TO NAVIGATE LIFE AFTER BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND DON’T KNOW WHERE TO TURN?

Breast health has become an important topic for both women and men. But with a huge amount of conflicting and confusing information out there, it can be hard to find the advice, support and care that you need.

My Breast My Health was created to make understanding breast health easy. Whether you’re looking to learn how to keep your breasts healthy, concerned about new symptoms or learning to live post-diagnosis, you’re in the right place.

Hi, I'm Dr Tasha

I’m a Doctor, Breast Cancer Surgeon and Medical Educator. After 20 years helping people to understand and overcome breast health problems, I’ve seen first hand the fear, frustration and stress that my patients go through.

As a breast specialist with over a decade’s worth of experience, I understand finding the right information, processing a diagnosis, understanding treatment and getting accurate, practical advice as you ride the rollercoaster of emotions can be really tough.

But I’m here to help.

The internet can be a wonderful source of information but when it comes to breast health there’s a lot of inaccurate information out there. Listening to the wrong advice could cause you unnecessary worry or even put your health at risk.

So I wanted to create an accessible hub where you could find useful, accurate and reliable information from a trusted source – a Breast Health Doctor – all in one place.

That’s exactly what you’ll find here on my YouTube Channel.

Putting the phone on speaker is a great starting point but there is so much more you can consider trying, assuming the parent would like to try too (always follow their lead and respect their choices).

It’s ok if the baby falls asleep, needs to be fed, or is in a playful mood. Consider incorporating the parent into these moments for meaningful connection.

Carry this beyond the visit by:
- asking the parent for a lovey that they sleep with for a few nights so it smells like the parent
- use recorded voice story books
- get recorded videos of the parent talking to the baby or singing a song, playing peek a boo, etc.","0","00:00:54",People & Blogs,"{fostercare,fosterparent,fosterparenting}",NA,youtube,NA,Fostering meaningful connections_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isadCrAD8eQ,Depersonalization

Work-life balance techniques,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTtGX-9gE0w,Simple techniques for greater work-life balance - New Day NW,KING 5 Seattle,unknown,"137","2",0,"0","Since the pandemic hit in 2020 causing companies to shift to remote work, many people have seen the boundaries between their work and family lives break down. Whether they have worked more hours in their home offices and brought work stress directly to their families, or faced challenges attending to the greater needs of their loved ones, especially with kids schooling from home, many have struggled to show up fully in all aspects of their lives.

Mark Briggs, KING 5's former digital director, has experienced this first hand. After his family was torn apart, he was driven to investigate work-life balance and interviewed hundreds of people in the prime of their careers. He compiled what he learned, including stories of resilience, lessons learned, and simple but powerful techniques for work-life harmony in his new book, ""The Butterfly Impact.""

Briggs joined New Day NW to talk about the book and share advice on maintaining work-life harmony and spending more time on what we value.

ABOUT THE BOOK:

Do you feel like your work and your personal life are pulling you in opposite directions? Like the more you’re there for one, the less you’re there for the other? After his family was torn apart—twice—former journalist Mark Briggs launched a full-scale investigation into work-life balance. What he discovered was a surprising framework of small, simple changes that can send powerful ripple effects throughout your life—both at work and at home. In researching ""The Butterfly Impact,"" Mark interviewed over one hundred people at the prime of their careers—including industry leaders at Starbucks, Facebook, Google, Amazon, REI, The Gates Foundation, Good Morning America, and Gonzaga University's legendary basketball team. Here, you’ll read their relatable stories of resilience, grit, and triumph. Each chapter also includes practical activities to help you develop your own balance, excelling in your career while thriving in your personal life. ""The Butterfly Impact"" includes helpful advice and tips to help you show up fully at work and be fully present at home for what matters most.

Brian Bullock

""My story, my life, and my voice matter. I didn't always feel this way. I was raised by a single mother with an absent father. I did not let my background define me. I survived my circumstances because I could see my future, and my future is worth it. With glimpses of hope, I held on to my vision with passion, and started to create the blueprints of legacy. I wrote this to be an inspiration, to bring others to life. To encourage and build an enduring future anyone can live out. This the way for you to start living your best intentional life.""

Professional attachment with detachment
Epic – In the battle field, while mentoring and counseling Arjuna, Krishna asked “why are you worried? Arjun asked, “Oh Krishna! Do I call a soul as my grandfather? Is my affection merely towards a soul? Is that white clad elderly man just a soul? Did not the body which you call the soul’s clothing have come to bless me many times? Is the sage who taught me archery skill merely a soul? Oh Krishna, I do not deny the souls are holy and indestructible? But I am talking about body. Am I not related to these bodies? Souls are not born but surely people are.” Krishna replied “yes of course people are born, but people those who are born would eventually die. Then why grieve for the predestined? Those who are born would die. But this death is not the end, since they would reborn. This is unshakable truth and no one can avoid it. Not me. Not you. Nobody. Bhishma has the boon of wishful death, but death is still inevitable for him as well. In this cycle of birth, death and rebirth, where is the place for grievance?
Management lesson – Getting emotionally attached to the current organization, reporting manager, colleagues and reportees is good. However too much emotional attachment is not desirable, since separation with them is inevitable. Separation will certainly happen through superannuation, or voluntary or involuntary attrition, job rotation, transfer or could be demise. This is written on the wall. Like a soul gets a new body, a professional enters into a new organization or role and gets a new set of colleagues who could be his new reporting manager, peer or reportee. Hence separation of a professional from the organization or role is predestined, predetermined, inevitable, unavoidable and a truth of life. It could be sooner or later. Some professionals stick to one organization or one role for the entire career like a soul is with a body for a quite long time, whereas some professionals change the organization or role like a soul changes the body after a time interval. Hence grief has limited space in the emotion of a true professional. One should be thankful for their time of togetherness and move on happily.

Job satisfaction tips,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6Meb_VByLg,What is Employee Satisfaction | Employee Satisfaction Surveys | Employee Feedback Forms,SurveySparrow,unknown,"6234","78",0,"0","Employee satisfaction is, quite simply, how content employees are with their jobs in an organization. 

Companies need to keep their employees happy and reduce turnover.

Employee Satisfaction is typically measured using employee feedback forms, and factors that influence these might include:

Compensation, workload, perceptions of management, flexibility,  teamwork, resources etc. 

With regular feedback opportunities in place, employers can monitor employee happiness and see where they need to make changes to improve the workplace experience for everyone.

Employee satisfaction surveys can be conducted in person or online, either in a closed setting or an open-ended format.

During an employee survey, you can quickly get a sense of how well your employees are doing by asking them questions about what's working and what isn't. 

Employee satisfaction surveys will also help you figure out exactly where your company needs improvement. 

And this can fix those areas before they become problems for everyone involved in the business.

The more insight you have into your employees' feelings, the better equipped you are to nurture their happiness and satisfaction with your organization.

Since employee satisfaction is such an important metric, it's helpful to know whether or not you're meeting benchmarks.

Watch the video to know more about employee satisfaction.

Mandy’s first contact with the world of addiction, mental health and recovery was when she came into treatment in 1990. Her passion for therapy and its potential for change ignited here, inspiring her to make therapy her life’s work. Alongside a growing private practice Mandy always gave time to promote early intervention through lectures on addiction, emotional coping mechanisms and self-esteem as part of the PSHE (Personal, Social & Health Education) provision within independent schools. In 2008, with a busy private practice and many years of recovery under her belt, Mandy founded CHARTER Harley Street, an outpatient centre treating addiction and trauma using her pioneering model of care.

[00:00:00.51] As cliche as it all is it really makes a huge difference on nutrition, sleeping well, exercise, finding breaks throughout the day. Instead of taking a whole hour for lunch. OK well you know what maybe take four or five breaks throughout the day.

[00:00:22.30] Bonnie Pedota, Peer Support Specialist.

(SPEECH)
[00:00:22.65] I'm going to try to have social time with my coworkers because I know that can be effective for me. I'm going to use-- If stuff gets really stressful I'll use those cognitive behavioral therapy strategies. If I need if I feel like I'm really tense then I'm really going to go into my benefit package at work I'm going to go for massage therapy or chiropractic care or I might. I recently started to access the counseling that's available through my workplace so I'm making sure once a month that I'm getting in with a counselor just to talk about what's going on for me. So it's really about continuing to broaden the toolkit and then also knowing what do I need to draw on here given whatever stressors going on for me.

[00:01:05.04] Sometimes if I feel I'm off I'll get up go for a walk and come back

[00:01:14.35] Donna Hardaker, Management Consultant.

(SPEECH)
[00:01:14.67] I use lots of different modalities to deal with them. So I use cognitive behavioral therapy, I've done self hypnosis, a lot of deep breathing and sort of self-consciousness, being in nature, things like that can be very helpful. But this is a pervasive constant experience I have. And rather than thinking I'm a failure because I still have them instead I just accept that this might be the way I always have an experience inside my head and it doesn't mean I'm a bad person or that I'm weak or that I'm a failure instead it's just part of my existence.

(DESCRIPTION)
[00:01:51.63] Melonie Long, Child and Youth Counselor.

(SPEECH)
[00:01:52.02] If I feel that I have reacted inappropriately or a little extreme and I can tell that, that person now is sort of standing off. I will ask them if I can buy them a coffee or go to lunch with them and I will say, because I'd like to talk. And then when I get alone with them, I say, I think I owe you an apology. I'm struggling with depression and anxiety right now, and I'm not very happy about the way I responded, and I'm hoping that we can get back to where we were before because I really value your relationship.

[00:02:33.04] So if I know that certain work is going to come my way, I will attempt to supply information to the person who's going to be giving it to me about what would work best for me in that regard. Do I have any choices inside of it?

(DESCRIPTION)
[00:02:45.22] Hardaker.

(SPEECH)
[00:02:46.14] So I do a lot of managing up with any supervisor that I have. And I've become adept at those skills because I've used them so much over time because I know that if I just accept the way workplace systems impact me I will fail.

And if I'm avoiding them why am I avoiding them so asking those questions to myself as well and making sure that I keep myself at do a lot of self care to make sure that I'm taking care of myself.

Rejuvenating energy levels,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdlYOcNJCEQ,Microneedling for skin rejuvenation,Dr Davin Lim,unknown,"54530","332",0,"26","Micro needling for skin rejuvenation. This procedure also treats upper lip wrinkles and smoker's lines.
Upper lip lines, smoker’s creases and wrinkles, and sun damaged skin can be treated with lasers, fillers, BOTOX or a new device called INFINI microneedling radiofrequency.

Upper lip wrinkles with sun damage that involves the middle to deep layers of the skin respond best to INFINI microneedling radiofrequency. This treatment uses state of the art insulated microneedles that delivers energy in the form of radiofrequency to remodel collagen, rejuvenate the skin, diminish wrinkles, open pores and even surgical and acne scars. Unlike lasers such as Fraxel, CO2 Fractional, ProFractional, Halo, Pixel or Portrait, microneedling spares the upper layers of the skin, and delivers controlled energy into the dermal layers. What does this mean for the patient?

1. INFINI microneedling radiofrequency treatment gives a much faster healing time than even the best fractional lasers. INFINI is a form of fractional skin rejuvenation, but unlike lasers, the energy is not absorbed on the skin- its delivered deep into the skin, beneath the epidermis. Most of my patients are treated on a Friday afternoon, or Saturday morning, and they are right for work on Monday. INFINI really is a minimal downtime procedure. As a guide, if I were to perform Fraxel Fractional laser resurfacing, recovery will be at least 5 days. 

2. INFINI works much better than conventional microneedling. This is because it delivers energy (controlled heating) with insulated needles. The delivery system can target areas up to 3.5 mm deep. Additionally, I can adjust INFINI to treat different depths. For upper lip treatments, I typically deliver 2 passes at 3- 3.5 mm followed by another 2-3 passes at 2.0-2.5 mm. This means the upper lip area has approximately 5,000 micro channels (much like skin needling channels- but accurately placed in different depths, with the added benefit of radiofrequency heating). 

3. Depending on the severity of sun damage, wrinkle depth, and extent of upper lip smoker’s lines, 2-4 sessions are needed for optimal outcomes. 


For those who really want to understand this revolutionary technology, it is the way INFINI microneedles that gives this device such flexibility to tailor treatments according to skin conditions such as wrinkles, skin laxity, open pores, blackheads, scars, neck and chest rejuvenation and overall 3- dimensional facial rejuvenation. 

Skin needle insulation is part of the answer- this means the upper layers of skin are spared from energy (heat), and only the deeper layers are treated. This means very little of the energy is loss on the surface (the opposite is true for fractional lasers). Now, here is the technical side of things- a good machine can also be flexible in the energy delivery – INFINI allows me to adjust the energy levels at different depths, and also what is known as the pulse duration- meaning the length of heating. The longer the pulse duration the more collagen stimulation will be achieved- this in turn translates to shallower upper lip and smoker’s lines. 

What else do I do with INFINI? Depending on the amount of superficial sun damage on the upper lip and surrounding skin, I sometimes combine this treatment with 1927 FRAXEL. Remember, Fraxel 1927- 1550 is best for more superficial problems such as skin pigmentation, melasma, and shallow acne scars. Lately I have been combining PRP or platelet rich plasma with INFINI. The logic behind this is that skin needling – microneedling has already given me over 5,000 micro channels to deliver collagen stimulating growth factors, cytokines, and stem cells. Combining PRP and INFINI microneedling gives both better results with the added bonus of quicker recovery times. 

For patients that want that extra dermal hydration I often perform Restylane or Juvederm Volbella to treat fine lines after a course of Infini Microneedling sessions. 


I often get asked the question, will microneedling or skin rolling with ebay and amazon kits deliver the same result? The answer is no. Home skin rollers- Derma Rollers and Dermapen can improve wrinkles, scars and skin laxity, but not to the degree of insulated energy devices such as INFINI.

The Gold Play Button is a physical trophy that features a gold-plated play button symbol mounted on a rectangular frame with a clear acrylic panel.

The Gold Play Button is presented to the channel owner as a way to celebrate their achievement and to recognize the impact and success they have had on the platform. It is designed to be a visible reminder of the creator's dedication and hard work, and to inspire them to continue creating engaging and meaningful content for their audience.

The play button symbol on the Gold Creator Award is made of a separate piece of metal that is also gold-plated. The symbol is mounted on a clear acrylic panel, which is in turn mounted on a metal frame with a matte black finish. The YouTube logo and the name of the channel are engraved on the acrylic panel using a laser etching process.

In addition to the Gold Play Button, YouTube also offers Creator Awards for channels that reach 100,000 subscribers (Silver Play Button), 10 million subscribers (Diamond Play Button), and 50 million subscribers (Ruby Play Button). Each of these awards features a similar design to the Gold Play Button, with different materials and finishes to reflect the achievement being recognized.

Work-life balance strategies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGW7ik4xse4,How To Have Work Life Balance As An Entrepreneur,Marketing Secrets,unknown,"7109","505",0,"35","Like many people, you too might believe that you need to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year in order to be successful. 

The fact is, you are not completely wrong.

If you do want to be successful, you do need to work hard and hustle but the key is in the duration of time that you are hustling for.

Earlier this year while at our 2CCX Mastermind in Paradise event in Mexico, I gave a presentation where I explain how I achieve work life balance through periods of radical imbalance. 

In this presentation I share the two types of goals everyone should be reaching for as a business owner and/or entrepreneur. 

Once you understand the difference, you will no longer wonder how work life balance is even possible for entrepreneurs.

اسی طرح سٹریس کا اثر بھی ذہن اور جسم دونوں پر ہوتا ہے۔بہن پر جو اثرات آتے ہیں وہ ہے اداس رہنا اتنا پریشان رہنا یا بات بات پر غصہ آنا یا منفی سوچوں کا ذہن سے نہ نکلنا۔اور اسی طرح جسم پر جو اثرات آتے ہیں اس میں شامل ہے جسمانی کمزوری سر درد بھوک کا نہ لگنا۔ نیند کا اچھا نہ آنا انا وزن کم ہو جانا۔

Sometimes employee wants some recognition for getting a task done. If an employee spends a lot of time working on a project, employer should praise him.  It’s not just about the act of recognition, but the principle: If people feel that their efforts are appreciated, they will feel motivated to continue working hard. Employees whose achievements were recognized have reported that they felt more job satisfaction. But if they feel like their long hours were for nothing, it’s unlikely that they would do anything valuable for the company again. So, it's important that you start to show hardworking employees your gratitude.","0","00:00:49",People & Blogs,{},NA,youtube,NA,Recognizing accomplishments_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhUuXh-Pll0,Personal achievement

He explains research indicates that it can be helpful to structure important tasks or events in a way that takes advantage of when our brains are functioning at their best. Davis points to research that shows that judges tend to make poorer decisions as the day goes on and mental fatigue sets in. He suggests different strategies for maximizing mental energy and for revitalizing brain function.

It's important to take out 30 minutes to care for ourselves daily.

The immune system is your body's defense system to environmental threats. It does have an ability to change and heal rapidly, as cellular turnover is very quick. However, with all of the dynamic cellular processes occurring in this system, protecting your body from senescent cells is essential for whole body health. Jeffrey Bland explains how immuno-rejuvenation works, discusses studies and research, and advises on how to renew your immune system at a cellular level. This is an important discussion in functional nutrition and integrative medicine.

| ABOUT REBECCA & INNER ARCHITECTURE |

Originally from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, I’m grateful to have lived in a few lovely places around the world before landing in Basel, Switzerland. After nearly ten years as an Interior Architect and Workplace Design Strategist, I realised that I was being drawn to spend more time with the people and less time with creating the physical spaces. In 2012, my curiosity sparked a journey of self-exploration that led to the founding of Inner Architecture – the playfully serious work of creating internal stability for external ease through mindset and inner-dialogue work.

I started creating these Inner Architecture Mini videos to document the learnings from my own experiences and learnings as I navigate and uncover new territory within the human mind. Every story I was sharing with clients seemed to bring some spark of insight, so I decided to put them out in the hopes that these stories might inspire you. I’m incredibly grateful to do the work that I love every day, and I’m grateful to you for taking the time to connect and share in the learnings.","0","00:05:06",Education,"{yt:cc=on,""inner architecture"",""mindset coaching"",""rebecca roberts"",""inner architecture coaching"",""mental fatigue"",""brain fog"",""how to overcome mental fatigue"",""fatigue and anxiety"",""emotional fatigue"",""eliminate mental fatigue"",""how to eliminate stress"",""mind hacks"",""mental fatigue recovery"",""mental fatigue excercise"",""mindset coaching topics"",""mental fatigue symptoms"",""mental fatigue treatment"",""how to eliminate stress from your life"",""mind hacks for mental toughness""}",NA,youtube,NA,Overcoming mental fatigue_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT0K2Rm85xo,Emotional exhaustion

It's been estimated that up to 70% of U.S. workers are emotionally disconnected from their workplaces. The lack of recognition is certainly one reason.

Could the person you see every day have an empathy deficit? 

Whether it is watching a friend go through a bad breakup or seeing a dog break its leg, their suffering may elicit a deep sense of sadness - almost as if we are experiencing it. This ability to experience the pain, despair, and feelings of others is called empathy. 

From an evolutionary perspective, understanding the pain of others motivated our ancestors to respond with compassion. Therefore, being empathetic towards others meant the survival of our species through ""mutual aid."" 

UNFORTUNATELY, not all people have the ability to empathize with others. These people are hurtful in terms of the words they speak and the actions they commit. They can be your friends, partners, and even your family members. That is why we have put down 11 signs on how to spot people who lack empathy almost immediately. We understand that you need to be prepared and aware of these people.

Life can often get chaotic. Yet the messy moments are also the key to our growth. At this special event, Dr Neeta Bhushan will share her insights from years of researching human behaviour and observing people in their worst and best moments. Using a blend of psychology, neuroscience and ancient philosophies, she'll explore what it takes to navigate challenges and get back up when life knocks you down.

By learning to normalise the messy human moments we all face on this beautiful journey of life, we can build our resilience. Neeta will share how four components shape your individual 'Bounce Factor' - and explain how you can navigate the five stages of Falling, Igniting, Rising, Magnifying and Thriving.

We all have the potential to build our mental fitness and expand our emotional skills. Neeta will give you permission to embrace the chaos and find ways to grow and respond positively to whatever life throws at you.

THE QUANTUM REJUVENATION FORMULA FROM Theta Realms - Brainwave Sound Journeys. Is a powerful brainwave meditation that goes deep and provides deep altered states of meditation as well as SONIC HEALING EXPERIENCE. VERY POWERFUL VIBRATIONAL HEALING SENSATION. Plus the usual potential effects of lucid dreaming and astral projection / out of body experiences.

Covering up to 8 brainwave frequency sonic vibrations ( or brainwave states ) at once. The frequency settings range from low 0.5 epsilon through 4 Hz ALL AT ONCE. 

Making this a most powerful quantum rejuvenation meditation indeed. The exact frequency settings within this range will be kept to my self making sure that the quantum rejuvenation formula is not duplicated and is a theta realms exclusive brainwave meditation.

OTHER FEATURES: This formula is also utilizing a combination of 9 TONES - RESONATING AT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT FREQUENCY SETTINGS.

40 HZ + 80 HZ + 126 HZ + 136 HZ + 728 HZ + 528 HZ + 741 HZ + 852 HZ

EVEN WITH THE INFO PROVIDED there is allot of customization that is being kept to my self. There is absolutely no way to replicate this formula 100% - so i proudly present the most powerful quantum rejuvenation formula from theta realms.

THERE IS NO NEED TO LIST A MASSIVE LIST OF POTENTIAL HEALING AND RESTORATIVE AND REJUVENATING EFFECTS - ONE JUST HAS TO LAY DOWN AND RELAX AND ENJOY THE MEDITATION - EVEN ONE HOUR IN DEEP STATE WITH THIS FORMULA WILL REJUVENATE MOST PEOPLE WITH NEW ENERGY. IMPROVE MUSCLE RECOVERY AND ENERGY BALANCING EFFECTS.

THE HYPER VIBRATION RELAXATION WILL MESSAGE NOT ONLY YOUR BRAIN BUT YOUR WHOLE BEING..YOUR BODY INCLUDED. STRESS? WHAT STRESS...TRY TO FEEL STRESS WITH THIS. THE RELEASE OF TENSION STRESS AND WORRY IS HEALING IN OF ITS SELF.

Aside from making time for exercise, eating a proper diet, and getting enough sleep each night, there are other things we need to consider and incorporate into our life to help us recover from burnout. Some things to consider are how long of a break or vacation we need to take to give our brain time to heal? Have you ever come back from a vacation and felt totally rested? Or maybe you come back just as stressed out. Think about this for a bit, and also consider the type of break you need. Maybe you need to sit around and do nothing for 7 days, or maybe you like to get outside and hike or bike, or perhaps you prefer to see the world and experience different cultures. Take some time to consider what types of breaks you need and how often you need them.

Job satisfaction tips,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAVIA4D4Ydc,How To Reinforce Employee Satisfaction | Five Qualities Of An Effective Leader,Karie Kaufmann,unknown,"731","35",0,"5","👉 If you enjoy this video, don't forget to subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/KarieKaufmann?sub_confirmation=1

In order to ensure employee satisfaction in your organization, it’s important to understand the qualities of an effective leader. In this video, I share five things that all leaders should do in order to be a better boss.

The first thing is to be available. This doesn’t mean you should have an open door policy, rather, it means that you should schedule one-on-one time with your direct reports. During these meetings, try to get to know them. What are their goals? What are their challenges? 

The second tip is to express your feelings to employees. When you have something nice to say, don’t hold back. By showing your emotions to employees and congratulating them when you really feel they are doing a great job, you can help build trust and employee satisfaction.

Third, is to assume responsibility. This is one of the most important qualities of an effective leader because the performance of your employees is ultimately dependent on you. If someone is having a problem, think about how you hired them, onboarded them, and trained them. By doing so, you may be able to figure out where things went wrong and how you can help them be more successful.

The fourth tip is to be fun. Your employees spend a lot of time in the workplace. Make it enjoyable for them.

And lastly, provide opportunities. Make sure that your employees are given the chance to learn and grow in the direction of their goals. To do so, you may have to take a step back at times.

Employee satisfaction is key to productivity. If you can develop some of these qualities of an effective leader, your team will be able to perform at a higher level.

Professional growth and development,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFJkww0LwOI,What to Put Into a Career Development Plan,Enhance.training,unknown,"8646","128",0,"6","What to put into a career development plan to really engage employees, motivate them and keep them doing the best job they can. Learn about 6 actions to drive retention, motivation, and performance. 

Creating a career development plan takes some thought and putting the career plan into action takes effort. Career planning is good for you, the team and the individual.

Career development proactively helps the employee to learn new skills and gain new experience which helps them deliver more for the company in which they work. Retaining staff makes all the investments you have made in the staff even more worthwhile, and you get the benefits of their increased skills for longer.

Writing an effective career plan requires at least 6 actions. The first is helping the team member decide on where they want to take their career. i.e. What is their professional goal. Without a goal, it is hard to work out where their career is heading and therefore how to help them. 

Once they have chosen a goal, the next step is working out all the steps between where they are now and where they want to get to. Create a career map to capture all the career development roles available on the route.

I recommend choosing to focus on the next two role along your prepared career route so that you have a career development plan covering the next 5 years. 
Fourth, Get the team member to spend time researching the skills, experience and qualifications needed for the next two roles. I suggest several effective ways of doing this.

Then look at the gap between where they are now and the skills etc they need to progress to the next role for their career development. Look at the specific gaps and the scale of those gaps. 

Finally, you are in a position to assign projects, tasks, activities i.e. the actions that will help the employee develop their career towards their career goals. I take you briefly through 11 different ways of helping your employee build their skills and experience.

You will know what to put in a career development plan, have plenty of tips on how to put it into practice and hopefully more committed and motivated employees with building skills to help the company be even more successful.

In this video, I want to share with you my thoughts on the impact of detachment on personal and professional growth. As someone who has struggled with attachment in the past, I've come to realize how much it can hold us back from reaching our full potential.

Detachment, in my experience, means letting go of our attachments to certain outcomes, people, or things that we believe will make us happy or successful. It's about learning to accept what is and focus on what we can control, rather than getting caught up in what we can't.

By practicing detachment, I've been able to develop a greater sense of inner peace and resilience, which has helped me to navigate life's challenges with more ease and grace. I've also found that detachment has allowed me to let go of limiting beliefs and behaviors that were holding me back from achieving my goals.

In this video, I'll be sharing some tips and strategies for cultivating detachment in your own life, so that you can experience greater personal and professional growth. Whether you're struggling with attachment in your relationships, your career, or your personal development, I believe that these insights will be helpful for you.

So if you're ready to let go of what's holding you back and step into your fullest potential, then join me for this video on the impact of detachment on personal and professional growth.","0","00:05:07",Entertainment,"{""Personal growth"",""Professional growth"",Detachment,""Letting go"",""Limiting beliefs"",Resilience,""Inner peace"",Self-improvement,Attachment,""Emotional detachment"",Mindfulness,""Overcoming obstacles"",Self-awareness,""Positive psychology"",""Growth mindset.""}",NA,youtube,NA,Professional detachment_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHrRrVXKQ8E,Depersonalization

Growing up in the United States as a very Americanized young man, he returned to Taiwan for high school and later served in the Taiwanese Army. After his army service, Anthony worked as a marketing manager for a Taiwan based company and traveled overseas for his work. Eventually he decided to return to the United States to pursue a college education. At Penn State Behrend, Anthony has served two terms as the president of the International Student Organization and has orchestrated various programs to promote diversity, help international students and domestic students to overcome stereotypes in order to achieve a deeper respect for different cultures. It is with the unique experiences growing up, serving in the army, working in marketing and sales overseas as well as being a student leader that inspired Anthony to talk about the importance of intercultural communication. This is a concept that has become increasingly important to understand as the world becomes more globalized.

While all of these are crucial pieces of a positive work environment, one factor affects the impact of each: health and wellbeing. 

The buildings we spend time in deeply affect our health! 

This is what the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI) is communicating to architects, designers, and workers across industries and borders. 

In this video we hear from CEO and President of IWBI, Rachel Hodgdon, about how things like air quality, water quality, and even seat placement shape not only how we perform at work, but how physically and mentally healthy we are. 

You'll hear how a positive work environment is shaped by the actual environment in which you’re working, and how to improve your own work environment.

Most people understand the importance of empathy when it comes to our social lives – dealing with friends and loved ones. But why do we need empathy at work? 

You need effective communication in business even more than you need it in your personal life. Think of the last time you got into a disagreement at work. How did you resolve it? You can’t just kiss and make up, after all. 

Most conflict is the result of different perspectives. Both sides can be right. They’re just looking at things from where they stand, in light of their own needs. You can understand where the conflict is coming from through sharing other people's perspective.

Ask yourself what it’s like to be in their position. What is it like in sales? What do people have to go through in order to do their jobs? Owners and leaders know how to develop empathy in the workplace. They take every opportunity to understand the other person’s perspective. 

Talk to people. Find out what goes on during their day – what it’s like to be them. Try to see the world through their eyes. When you have empathy for their struggles in the company, you’ll be able to find the middle ground the next time there’s a workplace conflict. One of the marks of true leadership is knowing how to bring your team together to work towards a common goal.

As a leader with empathy, you can easily provide inspiration and motivation to your team because you understand them. Sharing other people's perspective gives you insight into what makes them tick. Knowing how to develop empathy in the workplace isn’t just a nice thing to do. It’s a highly effective business strategy.","0","00:01:47",Nonprofits & Activism,"{""sharing other people's perspective"",""how to develop empathy in the workplace"",""other people's perspective"",Empathy,""empathy in the workplace"",""understand perspectives"",""understanding perspectives"",""developing empathy"",""building empathy"",""empathy in workplace"",""develop empathy in the workplace"",perspective}",NA,youtube,NA,Building empathy in the workplace_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3YWyTsPn2I,Depersonalization

Black History Month 2017 is the first opportunity since his exit from the White House, to recognize the accomplishments of the first African-American President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, and the people's account of his accomplishments. 

Upon review of the many lists of President Obama's accomplishments that have been documented and reported by various sources, ExpressYourselfBlog wanted to take a look at a few of the less known. Those often forgotten, but ever so important policies that greatly benefitted everyday people. That is not to say some of the most notable accomplishments did not have a profound impact on our everyday living. The capture and execution of Osama Bin Laden, the Terrorist U.S. identified as being responsible for the attack on theWorld Trade Center', killing thousands of Americans certainly gave citizens a great sense of safety.

The top 10 list chosen by ExpressYourselfBlog, is representative of our #TopTableTopics series of what is most top of mind for everyday Americans like finances, jobs, raising a family, affordable education, etc. The list was compiled by ExpressYourselfBlog.com, derived from, and comprised by 'Washington Monthly Magazine, 'Obama's Top 50 Accomplishments' in support of our focus. The article was published in 2012, so he was just getting started. 

History will be written and rewritten by news organizations, scholars, and historians alike. ExpressYourselfBlog wanted to capture the sentiment of the people. Stay tuned for ExpressYourselfBlog's 2nd half of the people's account of accomplishments by the Obama administration that had the most impact on their day-to-day during '2017 Black History Month'.

AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ACTION: We want to hear from you. Offer feedback on policies implemented by the Obama administration that most impacted you and your families lives, and use #RecognizePOTUS44.

Most career and job search strategies bombard people with messages telling you to a-million-and-one things like: craft an outstanding resume, write an attention-grabbing cover letter, do an extensive job search, go networking often, reframe your weaknesses, upsell your strengths, impress the recruiters, and upgrade your technical skills.

While those may be a necessary part of the equation to building a meaningful career, it isn't the right place to start.  Starting there often leaves even the highest performing professional feeling frustrated, uninspired, and beginning to second guess themselves.

Job postings are like advertisements. They were written by hired hands to attract candidates.

You need to be applying business development strategies to your worthy career goals.

If you don't do this, you can count on having negative thoughts creeping in about what's wrong with your resume, your background, age, experience, or anything you might think is putting you at a disadvantage.

There's actually a science behind how to find work you love and create a fulfilling career from it. 

It's my proven method behind how I orchestrated my career journey with meaning and purpose. 

And it's based on my expertise on the brain and human behavior so that you can be contributing your fullest in a career you're passionate about and gives you the compensation you deserve.

If you'd like to see how I found fulfillment and purpose in my career and how my students used the same method to get incredible results in their career, subscribe to my channel for new videos every week on Mondays and Thursdays as I show you how to build your own meaningful career, just be being more of who you already are!

Cognitive empathy, which is also referred to as theory of mind, is a person’s ability to understand the mental states of other people by looking at those people’s behaviors including facial expressions.

Affective empathy is somebody’s emotional reaction to another person’s affective state.

The 10 Personality Disorders:

Cluster A (odd, eccentric)
Paranoid Personality Disorder: pervasive pattern of distrust and hostility
Schizoid Personality Disorder: a tendency to be unresponsive to social dimensions, a loner
Schizotypal Personality Disorder: odd thinking, magical beliefs

Cluster B (erratic, dramatic) 
Antisocial Personality Disorder: criminality, irresponsibility, and impulsivity
Borderline Personality Disorder: fear of abandonment, relationship difficulties
Narcissistic Personality Disorder: grandiose sense of self-importance, arrogance, sense of entitlement
Histrionic Personality Disorder: attention seeking and provocative

Cluster C (anxious, fearful)
Avoidant Personality Disorder: not engaging in social situations out of fear of humiliation and rejection
Dependent Personality Disorder: over relying on somebody for support
Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder: perfectionism, rigid adherence to rules

Mindfulness might sound crazy or weird to a lot of people. People think of meditating or sitting in some dark, quiet room with incense and burning candles. But mindfulness doesn’t have to be that at all. It can be a simple, quick practice every day.

In this video, I share some ideas for how you can practice mindfulness in a few seconds every day. I also offer some technology-guided tools for mindfulness that can help you relax and get through the struggles we all face in our jobs every day.

Work-life balance strategies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq4E79OkOwc,Establishing a Work/Life Balance,GaryVee,unknown,"7195","134",0,"4","From early on in my relationship with my wife (I think it was the 2nd date), I communicated to her that if time goes on and I still didn't have my NY Jets, I was going to be working harder and was going to be a lot more busy :) I usually don't like discussing this subject because it's admittedly still something I struggle with, but the truth behind it all is that in order to have a true work/life balance, there needs to be communication between a person and their loved ones. 

Lizzie and I have a crazy scenario where I'm typically all-in with work Monday thru Friday and then when it comes to weekends, I turn everything off to spend time with my wife and kids. We've also began taking a lot more vacations to make up for time ""lost"" during the week. 

The moral of the story is that we communicated from day one about how we were going to make things work. As with many things with life, communication is crucial. So, as I've said over and over again, this boils down to context. Once you understand the situation you can ""hack"" your way to making it work for everyone involved.

Stress at most jobs is unavoidable. It could be caused by a boss who is very demanding, or a coworker who doesn’t pull his or her weight. Or maybe you have a typically stressful position, such as medicine or law. While some stress on the job can drive you to succeed and be healthy, too much can be very bad. It can cause many health problems and be detrimental.

According to Psychologist, emotional burnout is defined as a negative psychological state that may manifest physical, behavioral, and cognitive symptoms that impair our normal functioning and cause us severe distress. Are you wondering if you could be emotionally burnt out? Or are you looking for advice on how to recover from emotional burnout, how to manage stress, or how to avoid burnout? Stress is an inevitable part of life that we all have to deal with from time to time. It’s normal to feel exhaustion when you feel pressured or overwhelmed. However, when stress gets out of hand and becomes too much for us to cope with, then it begins to put your mental health at risk. So, we've made this video to help you be more aware of the signs you're emotionally burnt out. 

If you relate to this video and you're looking for tips on how to detox your emotional wellbeing, we have a video about that too: https://youtu.be/PAestsXAWsw

About Me:
I’m Emma McAdam. I’m a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, and I have worked in various settings of change and growth since 2004. My experience includes juvenile corrections, adventure therapy programs, wilderness therapy programs, an eating disorder treatment center, a residential treatment center, and I currently work in an outpatient therapy clinic.  

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction. 
And deeper than all of that, the Gospel of Jesus Christ orients my personal worldview and sense of security, peace, hope, and love https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe

Well, consider the ONE PERSON you’re leaving out of that picture. That’s right: it’s YOU.

A cohesive team culture starts and ends with you. As a leader, it’s your responsibility to set a vision for your workplace culture, and to design moments that will guide and foster that vision.

Emmy Award Winning Keynote Speaker Clint Pulver helps organizations that want to retain, engage and inspire their younger workforce. As the President and founder of The Center for Employee Retention, Clint has transformed how corporations like Keller Williams, AT&T and Hewlett Packard create lasting loyalty through his work and research as “The Undercover Millennial”.

He has appeared on America’s Got Talent and in several different Feature Films with actors like Jack Black (School of Rock) and John Heder (Napoleon Dynamite). Clint was named one of Business Q Magazine’s “Top 40 Under 40” for his work in helping corporations elevate their “WHY” of mentorship in the workplace and how connected and engaged employees yield loyal and long-term retention within organizations.

For over a decade, Clint has helped leadership teams diminish turnover, increase engagement and create an organization their people never want to leave. With a blend of humor, unforgettable stories, and actionable takeaways that stick, Clint convinces audiences on the power of “The Mentorship Effect,” and why some leaders create lasting loyalty and others don’t.

Led by Shelley Hastings, the Founder, Career Well-Being and Transformational Travel Coach of Synergy Empowerment Coaching, LLC. On the heels of pivoting of her business to help the hospitality industry at the onset of the pandemic, Shelley received the unexpected news of being diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disorder. In searching for answers as to what may have caused her autoimmune system to turn on itself, she was shocked to find a recurring theme throughout her research revealing that long-term effects of chronic stress can be a possible cause. Armed with this information, she made a decision to use her story and journey to prioritize and restore her health as the catalyst to reimagine her company with a new purpose. Shelley’s mission is to empower entrepreneurs and professionals who are feeling stressed, overwhelmed, and suffering from burnout to discover their optimal personal ratio of work-life synergy and infuse their lives with the transformative power of travel to boost their well-being.

For many people, the public health crisis has meant a sudden shift to remote work environments due to the importance of social distancing.

The transition to remote working and learning can be difficult, and finding balance within your life can become more complicated.  COVID-19 has left many people feeling burnt out, overworked, and stressed.  However, there are a few different ways you can manage your remote working environment in order to create a better work-life balance.

Webb, M.D.",unknown,"9645","235",0,"39","In this video, Dr. Webb discusses physician burnout and what things some physicians have done to avert it.

Link here: https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2018-lifestyle-burnout-depression-6009235#1

The health care environment—with its packed work days, demanding pace, time pressures, and emotional intensity—can put physicians and other clinicians at high risk for burnout. Burnout is a long-term stress reaction marked by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a lack of sense of personal accomplishment.

In recent years, the rising prevalence of burnout among clinicians (over 50 percent in some studies) has led to questions on how it affects access to care, patient safety, and care quality. Burned-out doctors are more likely to leave practice, which reduces patients’ access to and continuity of care. Burnout can also threaten patient safety and care quality when depersonalization leads to poor interactions with patients and when burned-out physicians suffer from impaired attention, memory, and executive function.

Burnout is defined as “a negative state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive stress and an inability to cope with it.” To educate ourselves and better understand the nature of burnout, especially when we ourselves are at risk, here are a few tell-tale signs that what you’re experiencing right now isn’t actually laziness, but burnout.

Building career fulfillment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTD8ZahogQM,"Build Your Confidence, Professional Fulfillment, Find Purpose at Work: Career Advisor Felicity Kleu",Bestselling Author Podcast,unknown,"20","0",0,"0","Felicity Kleu is one of the authors of the book entitled Beyond Limitations. ""Guidance and Opportunity to Grow"" is the title of her chapter.

The book Beyond Limitations is a compilation of inspiring stories of thought leaders, experts, and action takers from all walks of life who conquered adversity. This book will teach you how to harness the power of fear to accomplish personal breakthroughs and alter your life for the better.

Felicity talks about the problem of people not realizing they are unfulfilled in their chosen careers because we tend to settle for what we have without seeing what we can be and achieve.

Thus, Felicity’s goal is to help individuals decide if they are content. And if they are, that's great. But if not, what is it they want to do? 

Felicity worked as a licensed nurse for 38 years and encountered several issues. During that time, she also observes young people in other professions, where people just do it for the money but do not enjoy it.

Felicity shares the story of a person she’d talk to. This person worked in the bank and became a PA for different organizations. The person did well in those jobs but was never fulfilled or happy. Why? Because her attitude wasn't right at work. 

Felicity tells the method of how she helps people get through their problems. Interview, questioning, tools, and everything needed for the individual to step and gain personal confidence.

Felicity Kleu’s knowledge, passion, and wisdom provide us with the necessary steps to get through our struggles in our careers.","0","00:28:23",People & Blogs,"{""pat mesiti"",""felicity kleu"",""Career Advisor"",""beyond limitations""}",NA,youtube,NA,Building career fulfillment_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTD8ZahogQM,Personal achievement

Mental exhaustion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWaMO3tUuCA,"11 Signs You Are Mentally and Emotionally Exhausted",Psychology Element,unknown,"24074","836",0,"54","In today’s world, it isn’t surprising that many people find themselves struggling to be happy, or even just be mellow. Climate change concerns, politics, money, and relationships weigh people down even when they’re on vacation. The world is a sad, scary place sometimes, and it makes sense to be exhausted and feel sad occasionally. However, when it becomes a daily occurrence, it may be time to reflect on your personal needs and try to meet them. Today’s list is eleven signs that you’re physically and mentally exhausted.

While physical exhaustion may be easier to spot than anything else, mental and emotional exhaustion can oftentimes be overlooked, and the consequences for doing so could be deadly. Making sure that needs are met on every spectrum is the key to a long and healthy life. Make sure you stay until Number 1 because that’s a very important one to look for!

Title: Fostering Social Connection over Technology 
 
Abstract:
Despite the rise of social technologies that connect us with more people than ever before, feelings of social connection are alarming low, ultimately affecting our health and ability to function as a society. In this talk, I will present my work on technological interventions for social connection, leveraging the affordances of technology to bring people closer together rather than farther apart. I will first discuss expressive biosignals, or sensed physiological data displayed as social cues, and their potential to facilitate empathy and connection with both strangers and close others. I will end by describing my recent work exploring effortfully crafted AR experiences as a new means for people to stay in touch.
 
Bio:
Fannie Liu is a Vice President on the Global Technology Applied Research AR/VR team at JPMorgan Chase. Her interests include social computing, computer-mediated communication, mixed reality, and physiological sensing. She was previously a Research Scientist at Snap Inc., where she led several projects around developing and studying AR communication experiences. She graduated with her Ph.D. from the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where she was advised by Laura Dabbish and Geoff Kaufman. Her work has been published in top academic conferences such as CHI, CSCW, and IMWUT. Prior to CMU, she was a software engineer at LinkedIn.

In their book, The Why of Work, world-acclaimed leadership expert David Ulrich teams up with clinical psychologist Wendy Ulrich to explore the ""why"" of work—the common driving force behind every successful organization. Once you learn how to harness this force, you can:

*MAKE MEANING in the workplace—to bring out the best in everyone.
*CREATE VALUE for your employees, your customers, your company, and yourself.
*BUILD HOPE for the future by building ""the abundant organization.""

The Ulrichs' unique step-by-step system combines proven professional techniques and sharp psychological insights to bring new meaning to our work and its impact on the world outside the workplace. Filled with revealing questionnaires, checklists, interviews, and case studies, it's all you need to fully engage your team in the most challenging times—and to create a renewed sense of purpose, a sustainable source of commitment, and an environment that encourages and supports outstanding performance.

It’s time to shape up your empathy muscle. 

Empathy is in short supply these days—and it’s hurting all of us. From the rise in workplace tension and school bullying to increased anxiety and depression, a lack of empathy for one another is wearing away at the gears of society, grinding us down to the nubs. The very technology that is supposed to keep us connected is actually driving us apart, with face-to-face interactions on the decline and news filtered through an echo chamber that shelters us from other points of view.

But all is not lost. Just as physical workouts strengthen your body, there are ways to build up your empathy as well. In 'Tell Me More About That', Rob draws on his years of conducting thousands of in-home interviews with everyday people to illustrate the 5 Steps to Empathy—the actions you can take to build a strong and reflexive empathy muscle.","0","01:00:48",People & Blogs,"{BusinessPodcast,Community,""YourPartnerInSuccessradio DeniseGriffitts""}",NA,youtube,NA,Building empathy in the workplace_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbxl0RHXbCM,Depersonalization

There is a powerful connection between your emotions, intuition, and empathy. The magic comes when you learn how to tap into each of them to access your sensitivities without going on overload or becoming drained by challenging or stressful situations at work. Learning how to keep your center and avoid burnout in all situations is important to identify emotional triggers so you can master strategies to own the moment in your interactions.

Dr. Orloff is a psychiatrist, an empath and is on the UCLA Psychiatric Clinical Faculty. She synthesizes the pearls of traditional medicine with cutting edge knowledge of intuition, empathy, and energy awareness. She also specializes in treating empaths and highly sensitive people in her private practice and does online sessions with individuals and businesses internationally. Her work has been featured in O Magazine, Forbes, Business Insider, The London Sunday Times, CNN, The Today Show, PBS, BBC and NPR.

Empowerment self at work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOK6iyNNbjU,Empowering Leaders,GreggU,unknown,"683","9",0,"0","A leader’s power and influence increase when he or she shares power with others. Empowerment is therefore the basic component of shared or distributed leadership. In its basic meaning, empowerment refers to passing decision-making authority and responsibility from managers to group members. Almost any form of participative management, shared decision making, and delegation can be regarded as empowerment.

Work has meaning when there is a fit between the requirements of a work role and a person’s beliefs, values, and behaviors. A person who is doing meaningful work is likely to feel empowered. Competence, or self-efficacy, is an individual’s belief in his or her capability to perform a particular task well. People who feel competent believe that they have the capability to meet performance requirements in a given situation,

Self-determination is an individual’s sense of having a choice in initiating and regulating actions. A high-level form of self-determination occurs when workers feel that they can choose the best method to solve a particular problem. Impact is the degree to which the worker can influence strategic, administrative or operating outcomes on the job. Another dimension of true empowerment is for the group member to develop an internal commitment toward work goals. Internal commitment takes place when workers are committed to a particular project, person, or program for individual motives.

How adults handle daily routines and instructional goals impact how well children attach and respond to teachers and caregivers, which in turn affects children's feelings of security to explore their environment and make new discoveries. In this video, teachers, family child care providers, and experts discuss how adult relationships with children impact children's development, behavior, and readiness to learn. Strategies for building strong relationships with infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and Kindergartners are also shared.

I Noah Thomas, the creator of this channel, have been diagnosed hypogonadism  by a medical doctor and legally  prescribed the medically indicated treatment of Testosterone Replacement Therapy.  

My Story

My name is Noah and on May 18 2011, I had a rare reaction to a medication called VIVITROL and consequently, spiraled into a suicidal depression with depersonalization and anxiety. I lost 25 lbs in 4 weeks and was in full panic or near panic for 8 weeks straight mixed with the darkest most painful depression I cold have ever imagined. I immediately could not work and had to move in with my parents who, along with many siblings and friends, had to watch me 24/7 as I was a danger to myself.  Eventually I was hospitalized in the Psych Ward for a week. Getting through each day seemed truly unbearable and I knew I would surely die. I have been put on many many different doctor prescribed  SSRI's SNRI's Tricyclics, mood stabilizers, anti-psychotics, holistic meds, acupuncture and even a form of shock therapy called RTMS. I barely saw any improvement in my condition for a full year. It was decided I had treatment resistant depression and I spent nearly every moment in tears. Weeks after starting my newest round of medications (Seroquel & Nortryptaline) as a last ditch effort, I had my blood drawn for possible hormone imbalances and my Testosterone levels came back 200 ng/Dl and 150 ng/Dl. The average 25 year old male has 750 ng/Dl. With this discovery I had an explanation as to why I was not getting better and why I might be so so sick. The symptoms of Low T are very similar to those of major depression. I started legally prescribed testosterone replacement therapy soon after and have been checking in with the world and documenting my experience with treatment as well as giving my insight and perspective on various topics of mental health. I am blessed to say that I have slowly, over the last 6 years, been improving and becoming more stable which I never thought to be possible. My low T manifested itself in the form of Major depression, anxiety, and depersonalization/ derealization for over a year. Treating  my low testosterone has been 1 HUGE part of the puzzle but I have had to continue to work hard to hold on to my mental stability with many set backs.  Gaining some mental stability back is nothing short of a miracle as I was near death for what felt like forever. I do not consider myself to be totally healed yet but I am closer now then ever before and aim to use what I have been through to help or at least offer support to others in need I was able to successfully come off my Seroquel and Pamelor.

I work out all the time as a part of my mental health recovery!!! Weight training and all kinds of cardio rule much of my free time and I also share this on my channel.

Job satisfaction,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUR8z6AfV4o,Job Satisfaction,GreggU,unknown,"13887","131",0,"4","A person’s job satisfaction is a set of attitudes toward work. Work is an important part of life giving us self-worth, and people want to be happy, so naturally people want job satisfaction. Employees who are more satisfied with their jobs are generally better workers.

A job satisfaction survey is a process of determining employee attitudes about the job and work environment. Job satisfaction is a part of life satisfaction. Your off-the-job life also affects your job satisfaction, and in turn your job satisfaction affects your life satisfaction. Job satisfaction is on a continuum from low to high. The definition of job satisfaction identifies an overall attitude toward work, because people usually have positive attitudes about some aspects of work and negative attitudes about other aspects of work.

There are a variety of determinants of job satisfaction. Each of these determinants may be of great importance to some people and of little importance to others. Whether you enjoy performing the work itself has a major effect on overall job satisfaction. Your satisfaction with the pay received affects overall job satisfaction. And the rising cost of health care, along with retirement benefits, make benefits more important than ever.

Whether you are satisfied with personal or company growth and whether the potential for upward mobility exists may affect job satisfaction. Whether you are satisfied with the supervision received affects overall job satisfaction. The personal relationship between you and your boss also affects job satisfaction. Whether you have positive human relations with coworkers affects overall job satisfaction.","0","00:02:55",Education,"{""Human relations"",organization,organizations,organizational,""human behavior"",human,people,teams,team,""human resource"",""human resources"",""human resource management"",hr,hrm,""interpersonal relations"",relationships,""people skills"",professionalism,""organizational behavior"",""job satisfaction"",""satisfaction at work"",""employee satisfaction""}",NA,youtube,NA,Job satisfaction_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUR8z6AfV4o,Personal achievement

Building emotional resilience,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWH8N-BvhAw,The three secrets of resilient people | Lucy Hone | TEDxChristchurch,TEDx Talks,unknown,"1866037","38915",0,"985","Dr Lucy Hone is a resilience expert who thought she found her calling supporting people to recover following the Christchurch earthquake. She had no idea that her personal journey was about to take her to a far darker place. In this powerful and courageous talk, she shares the three strategies that got her through an unimaginable tragedy⁠—and offers a profound insight on human suffering. Dr Lucy Hone is a director of the New Zealand Institute of Wellbeing & Resilience, a research associate at AUT University, a published academic researcher, best-selling author and contributor to Psychology Today, the Sunday Star Times and Next magazine. 

She trained at the University of Pennsylvania and got her PhD in public health at AUT University in Auckland. She has helped a range of organisations—from primary schools to leading law firms—to design and implement wellbeing initiatives creating sustained and meaningful change. 

Five years ago, the sudden death of Lucy’s 12-year-old daughter Abi forced Lucy to turn her academic training and professional practice to foster resilience in very personal circumstances. The blog she wrote in the aftermath of Abi’s death attracted international attention and resulted in the best-selling non-fiction title, What Abi Taught Us, Strategies for Resilient Grieving (Allen & Unwin, 2016), now available as Resilient Grieving in the US, UK and NZ.

It's safe to say we all expected that to be the findings, but one of the major things that sticks out for me, is that we are so hyper focused on this crisis known as COVID19, vaccinations, hand washing, social distancing that we could easily lose sight of the crisis that is brewing in the shadows, and that’s the Mental Health crisis.

If we don’t start right now putting infrastructures in place to support teams, organizations, staff, your family and most importantly yourself, that when this dust finally settles we are going to be left with massive destruction as it relates to our country’s mental and emotional well-being.

Have you ever paid attention to how much mental energy your brain requires and uses each day?

I am going to provide you with some tips on how to overcome Mental Fatigue and how to get the best use out of your brain's resources. Because the better you feel, the better you perform.

Building positive relationships,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXasiI5SRwM,Building and maintaining positive relationships with students,KidsMathTV,"33900","26","0",0,"0","Building and maintaining positive relationships with students
Hello and welcome to our channel! Today, we're talking about building and maintaining positive relationships with students. As educators, it's important to remember that our relationship with our students can have a significant impact on their overall learning experience. A positive and supportive relationship can foster a sense of trust, respect, and engagement, leading to better academic performance and overall well-being. On the other hand, a negative or strained relationship can have the opposite effect, leading to disengagement and potentially even negative behaviors.

So, how can we build and maintain positive relationships with our students? Here are a few key strategies:

Show genuine interest and care for your students. This can be as simple as asking about their interests, goals, and challenges, and taking the time to listen and show empathy.

Set clear boundaries and expectations. It's important to establish clear expectations for behavior and academic performance, and to be consistent in enforcing them. This helps students understand what is expected of them and can help prevent misunderstandings or conflicts.

Use positive reinforcement. Instead of focusing on negative behaviors or mistakes, try to focus on and praise positive behaviors and effort. This can help students feel more motivated and engaged in the learning process.

Be open and approachable. Encourage students to ask questions, share ideas, and express their concerns. When students feel that they can approach you and that their thoughts and feelings are valued, they are more likely to feel connected and engaged in the learning process.

Be patient and understanding. Remember that students are at different stages of development and may not always understand or remember everything. It's important to be patient and understanding, and to provide additional support and resources when needed.

Use positive language and body language. The words and nonverbal cues we use can have a big impact on how students feel and perceive us. Using positive language and body language, such as smiling and maintaining eye contact, can help create a positive and supportive learning environment.

Foster a sense of community. Building a sense of community in the classroom can help students feel connected and supported. This can be achieved through activities that encourage collaboration and teamwork, and through creating a welcoming and inclusive environment.

By following these strategies, we can build and maintain positive relationships with our students, which can have a lasting impact on their learning experience and overall well-being.

While some viewers might find advice provided in this talk to be helpful as a complementary approach, several claims around brain size and lifestyle are not corroborated by sufficient scientific evidence. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf


Chronic stress is devastating for your brain. It ruins your memory, your attention and concentration and your emotional resilience. The brain areas that help execute these functions literally deteriorate. 

Luckily, brain science has revealed many ways to prevent or counteract this. In her talk Niki Korteweg shares the four most important things you can do to keep your brain healthy and working at its very best.

Niki Korteweg is a Dutch science journalist with a PhD in neurobiology, and she has been writing about health and brain science for almost 20 years. Ironically, after experiencing a burnout about 10 years ago, her own brain started to let her down. It was the start of a quest in the scientific literature to discover what actually helps to guard our brain against stress and make it work better than ever.  As a science journalist at NRC Handelsblad with a PhD in neurobiology, Niki is very knowledgeable about brain research, medical science, and psychology. She is a versatile journalist: she writes features, interviews, news articles, and books, gives lectures and teaches about science writing. After experiencing burnout in 2010, Niki published the book ‘Een beter brein’ (A better brain) in 2017. In this book, she discusses the fast-moving developments in neuroscience and all the ways in which we can use those insights to take good care of our brains.

This video focuses on two relaxing breathing techniques: Square breathing (aka box breathing, 4x4 breathing, 4-part breath, etc.) and Pursed breathing. More breathing exercises: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7-CAFhJn78

I start off with Square breathing. It’s so good at helping to relieve stress and anxiety that it’s sometimes used in the military to help calm nerves before stressful situations.

It’s performed just how it sounds--using your breath to make a square. Use imagery as well and imagine making a square or following something with a square pattern with your breath. Each position is 4 seconds. Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, and hold your breath again for 4 seconds. 

Pursed breathing is another breathing technique that can help relieve stress and anxiety, and it can also help make your lungs stronger. For this one, use diaphragmatic or belly breathing. Breathe in for 4 seconds, and then breathe out with pursed lips for 8 seconds.

Goal setting and achievement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdsnPhjY3KY,Goal setting and achievement : The Success Formula,The Success Formula,unknown,"5","0",0,"0","Hello and welcome to today's episode of our podcast. Today, we'll be discussing the topic of goal setting and achievement. Whether it's personal or professional goals, goal setting can be a powerful tool for success. In this episode, we'll be exploring some strategies and tips for effective goal setting and achieving your desired outcomes.

First and foremost, it's important to understand why goal setting is important. Setting clear and specific goals gives us direction and purpose. It helps us focus our efforts and energy towards achieving what we truly desire. In addition, setting measurable goals allows us to track our progress and stay motivated along the way.

So, what are some tips for setting effective goals? Here are some key points to keep in mind:

Be specific and measurable: When setting goals, it's important to be clear about what you want to achieve and how you will measure success. For instance, instead of setting a vague goal like ""I want to be more productive,"" you might set a specific goal like ""I want to complete three tasks per day that will contribute to my long-term goals.""

Make your goals challenging but achievable: It's important to set goals that push you outside your comfort zone, but that are still achievable. Setting overly difficult goals can be demotivating, while setting goals that are too easy can lead to complacency.

Set deadlines for your goals: Having a deadline creates a sense of urgency and helps keep you on track. Make sure the deadline is realistic and achievable.

Once you have set your goals, it's important to develop a plan of action. Break your goals down into smaller, more manageable steps. This will help you stay motivated and make progress towards your goal. Remember to track your progress and celebrate your small successes along the way.

Inevitably, there will be setbacks and obstacles along the way. It's important to remain resilient and adaptable. If something isn't working, adjust your approach and try again. Reframe setbacks as an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than as a failure.

Finally, surround yourself with positive influences. Find people who believe in you and your goals, and who can offer support and encouragement along the way.

Remember, goal setting is a process. It takes time, effort, and dedication to achieve your goals, but the rewards are worth it. Be patient with yourself, stay focused on your goals, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.

Do you feel drained after hours of ""trying"" to sleep? Or are you in need of a calming and relaxing sleeping ritual, so that you sleep all night? Then this blissfully calm guided meditation is made for you. Allow your Body, Mind and Spirit to naturally flow into a state of deep and rejuvenating sleep. 

This starts with guided meditation then moves into empowering affirmations, and ends with pure 528 Hz music with 3.5 Hz delta binaural beats for deep sleep. 

This is the third session of a series I have called; The Deep Sleep Meditation & Affirmations Series. This session focuses on Health, Healing and Happiness. Most people will fall asleep before the affirmations start. They are intentionally low in volume, but you can still hear them, however, you don't need to consciously pay attention to them. Your subconscious mind will absorb and reinforce the words while awake or in deep sleep.

FURTHER READING

“Cynicism has, in certain quarters, a distinct kind of glamour. It sounds tough not to have too many hopes – and to claim to see through the dreams of others.
Cynics will tell you that everyone is selfish and weak; that ‘the system’ is rigged and driven by greed; that you can never succeed so it’s pointless (and contemptible) to try; that all ideals are ridiculous and that ‘do gooders’ are only out to show off their own (supposed) virtues…”

Recovery from Chronic Fatigue | Linda Jones | TEDxBirminghamCityUniversity,TEDx Talks,unknown,"272394","7601",0,"763","In 2001 Linda Jones’s world changed. As a young and successful business woman she was living a happy and fulfilled life; working long hours travelling the country, a fitness fanatic who enjoyed a full social life. Looking back there was recognition that this was unsustainable. Early recognition signs and symptoms were ignored, and led to complete burn out. Linda’s journey to full recovery sparked a passion to help others as she set up Salus Fatigue Foundation In 2001, after illness, Linda Jones, CEO Salus Fatigue Foundation & Life4Changing was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. She lost everything.   Her relentless attitude, which caused her burnout in the first place, meant she wasn’t going to just accept that diagnosis and become a statistic. Determined to recover and get her life back she took a holistic approach and coached herself back to health.  
In the last 10 years, her journey to full recovery sparked a passion to help others and this idea became the Salus Fatigue Foundation. To date 15, 000 people have been helped to create a self-managed path to recovery through raising awareness and support programs.  Linda also heads up Life4Changing helping organisations boost employee engagement, productivity and performance.

Join us in this captivating episode as we discover the importance of creating a personal life plan.

In the hectic, day-to-day grind of law enforcement, it's easy to lose sight of your dreams and goals. Most law enforcement professionals come into the job with a desire to make a difference. They want to serve their community, promote to higher ranks, and enjoy a fulfilling career. But reality takes over. Too often, the daily call load takes its toll and leaves little energy or focus for anything else. 

That’s why it's essential to regain control of your career and life by creating a life plan.

Discover a simple step-by-step formula to follow to create a life plan—an intentional path toward achieving your goals and dreams. A life plan will propel your growth in your law enforcement career, in your personal life, and beyond by clarifying your direction and purpose.

Empathy and emotional connection,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33kgQumUP4,"6 Warning Signs Your Emotional Needs Are Not Met In A Relationship",BRAINY DOSE,unknown,"384105","8954",0,"780","Do you feel like your relationship is making you depressed? Then pay attention to the warning signs your emotional needs are not met in a relationship. There are plenty of emotionally unavailable men and emotionally unavailable women in relationships, leading to protest behavior and relationship conflict.

Emotional unavailability can be a result of attachment trauma during childhood. These people often develop an avoidant attachment style - meaning they try to avoid emotional connection at all costs. Ironically, they tend to attract partners with an anxious attachment style - who may have difficulty feeling secure in relationships. This combination can manifest as codependency. 

The good news is that couples can work through their problems and establish the connection, security, and independence they crave in their relationships.

Being empowered simply means we have the authority to make our own choices in our lives.  That we have the power to choose and be our selves.  To often do we all live out of fear and that feeling of fear ends up effecting our choice and path in life.  

Its time to retake our right to choose for ourselves, stop living out of fear, and to empower our lives so we can achieve the successes that we deserve.

Setting and achieving goals,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCRSVRD2EAk,Setting SMART Goals - How To Properly Set a Goal (animated),Better Than Yesterday,unknown,"942263","10435",0,"650","If you want to succeed, you need to set goals. Without them you lack focus and direction. They also provide you with a benchmark to determine whether or not you're actually succeeding at them.
We all struggle sometimes to achieve our plans. And it's not that we lack the effort, but our goals are not structured efficiently.
To accomplish your objective you need to know how to set it up properly. You can't simply say, ""I wish I could make more money"" and expect it to happen.
A goal without a plan is just a wish.
It is also important to recognize, that not all objectives are created equal.
So, today I'll explain the SMART method of goal setting and how it will amplify your chances of actually succeeding.

S stands for: Specific
Your goal must be clear and well defined. You can only get to where you want by defining precisely how you'll get there.

M stands for: Measurable
Tracking the progress of your goal is an important part of keeping you motivated. It allows you to set milestones that you can celebrate when you achieve them and reevaluate when you don’t.

A stands for: Attainable
Make sure that it's possible to achieve the dreams you set for yourself. Far too many people fall into the trap of setting impossible goals. While they may push you forward for a while, you will almost certainly end up giving up on them. Instead of being impossible, your goals should be challenging yet achievable.

R stands for: Relevant
Your plans should be relevant to the direction you want your life and career to take. A common issue we face, is having too many goals at the same time, or pursuing the wrong goals. Unless your plan is relevant to your overall life plan, achieving it may not accomplish anything.

T stands for: Time bound
This is one of the most important factors.
You plans must have a deadline. If you don't set a time limit you have basically unlimited time to achieve your goals.

But there's one last thing. Most people think that goal setting is a one time event. Like you set your goals once and you're done. However it's actually an ongoing process. It never ends.
Your plans will need evaluation and revision so it's important to stay flexible.

How good are you with money? What about reading people’s emotions? How healthy are you, compared to other people you know? Knowing how our skills stack up against others is useful in many ways. But psychological research suggests that we’re not very good at evaluating ourselves accurately. In fact, we frequently overestimate our own abilities. David Dunning describes the Dunning-Kruger effect.

Empathy deficit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQioGQ3QAgE,Stand in My Shoes: The Empathy Deficit in the Treatment of Depressed Patients,Dr James Stoxen DC,unknown,"912","5",0,"3","Watch as Dr. James Stoxen DC shares an excerpt about the Empathy Deficit (taken from The Empathy Deficit in the Treatment of Depressed Patients and The Inflammation-Depression Connection Approach at The 4th Anti-Aging And Regenerative Medicine Conference, Bangkok, Thailand 2012 September 7-9, 2012)

What is empathy? 

Empathy is the ability to identify with and/or feel another's feelings. It is the act of imaginatively standing in another's shoes and seeing the world through their eyes. It creates feelings of deep connectedness with others. Love can't happen without it. Neither can justice or peace or any other kind of beneficial relationship. Empathy is the glue that holds us together. And in a world that encourages self interest and mindless consumption above all else, it's a commodity in short supply.

Do we have an ""empathy deficit""? We see the costs of our ""me-first"" mindset: record breakdowns in relationships, endemic corruption, environmental degradation, inequitable social structures, and a whole generation increasingly unable to deeply connect--to anything or anyone. Now, scientists have confirmed we're experiencing a steep decline in our capacity for empathy.

Empathy is at the heart of human connection. It's the glue that keeps us together. With it in short supply, what will become of us as a species?

To find out the answers, we're hunting down the best and brightest ""social revolutionaries""--empathic leaders who are transforming the lives, structures and organizations around them.

Dr. Stoxen is one of the ""social revolutionaries"" who is tackling some of our most pressing world problems from an empathic perspective.

""Physicians are treating depression like the common cold giving out anti-depressants in a rushed office visit not showing empathy for their patients.""  

Dr. James Stoxen DC

(taken from the lecture The Empathy Deficit in the Treatment of Depressed Patients and The Inflammation-Depression Connection Approach at The 4th Anti-Aging And Regenerative Medicine Conference, Bangkok, Thailand 2012 September 7-9, 2012)

Dr. Stoxen also speaks about Richard Davidson, one of the world's top brain scientist, who began an ongoing study of the brains of Tibetan monks, the so-called ""Olympians"" of meditation, each of whom had accomplished at least 10,000 hours of meditation. The scans revealed significant activity in the insula, which is extremely important in detecting emotions. Increased in the temporal parietal juncture, particularly the right hemisphere. Studies have implicated this area as important in processing empathy, especially in perceiving the mental and emotional state of others.

Buddhist monks believe mental attributes and positive emotions such as compassion, loving kindness and empathy are skills that can be cultivated.

Science is beginning to back that up.

Job satisfaction tips,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTUwDAkChR4,"7 Simple & Free Ways For HR to Improve Employee Job Satisfaction || How to Satisfy with Our Job",TechMoodly,unknown,"3219","38",0,"2","7 Simple and Free Ways For HR to Improve Employee Job Satisfaction || How to Satisfy with Our Job .

Here are seven simple ways to inspire employees and increase employee satisfaction:
 Employee Orientation – One of the best ways to have satisfied employees is to make sure they’re pleased from the get-go. Offering a thorough orientation will ensure expectations are realistic and that new staffers don’t come in with rose-colored glasses that will quickly fade. Proper onboarding encourages positive attitudes and can reduce turnover.

2. Positive Work Environment – An upbeat workplace is a necessity. If the workspace isn’t positive, you can’t expect the workers to be. Encouraging one another, avoiding micromanagement, giving positive feedback and ensuring criticism is constructive are all ways to keep the environment a place where employees can do more than survive – they can thrive!

3. Provide Competitive Benefits – Fair wages are important, but competitive benefits are also critical to keeping your workforce satisfied. If your benefits package is thin, employees may look for other opportunities with firms that are more generous. Beyond insurance, benefits such as flex time, paid holidays and personal days are important factors to employee satisfaction.

4. Workforce Engagement – Employees that don’t find their work interesting or don’t feel they are contributing to the mission of the firm will not be engaged. For employees to be satisfied, they must feel like they are part of something bigger than just what their individual work tasks are. Include staffers in goal setting and how they fit in the corporation fabric to increase engagement and satisfaction.

5. Develop Skills – Everyone needs something to working toward. Stagnation is unfulfilling. Employees have more potential than their current level of functionality. Encouraging employees to fulfill that potential will increase engagement and satisfaction. Whether it’s training opportunities, mentoring, online courses or external training, encourage staff to always be improving their skills!

6. Recognition & Rewards – Employees enjoy an atta-boy and it need not be a public show to mean something to employees. Encourage supervisors and managers to acknowledge employees deeds on a daily basis. Also implement a formal program company-wide to recognize top achievers in every job category. Healthy competition can boost morale, encourage hard work and increase satisfaction and retention.

7. Track Job Satisfaction – Don’t sit back and just hope that employees are satisfied – put some data behind it. Offer anonymous online surveys or mobile surveys to effectively track how employees feel about benefits, recognition, supervisor feedback and other aspects that contribute to employee satisfaction. This allows you to improve, tweak and monitor satisfaction levels to reduce turnover and save the company money.

HR professionals have one of the most challenging jobs in a business because your job is considering everyone else’s job and how well they like it, how likely they are to quit or how their attitude affects coworkers. Increasing employee satisfaction through these and other measures can make your job (and everyone else’s) more satisfying and fulfilling!","0","00:03:18",Education,"{""how to motivate employees"",""job satisfaction"",""how to improve employee satisfaction in organization"",""how to increase job satisfaction in the workplace"",""recommendation of strategies to enhance job satisfaction"",""how to improve your job satisfaction"",""suggestion for job satisfaction project"",""pride system definition"",""employee satisfaction factors"",""what else would help you to do your job better and provide greater job satisfaction""}",NA,youtube,NA,Job satisfaction tips_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTUwDAkChR4,Personal achievement

What is emotional intelligence mostly referred to as EQ by many define emotional intelligence as a person's ability to recognize, understand, manage and reason with emotions?

Words have the ability to empower us. They can turn powerless into the fearless, the unloved into the loved, the hurting into the caring. But, unfortunately, with the spread of mass media, there also comes a lot of negativity in our lives. This negativity makes us and our surroundings see the world from a more desperate eye and therefore doesn't help us explore our full potential.

""[The concept of] Work-Life Balance sets us up to strive for something that is unreachable.""

Are you struggling to find time to balance your work and personal life? In this video, we're going to explore the topic of work life balance. ""Balance"" might not be the best way to view how our work life and personal life overlap... which begs the question, is 'work life balance' a myth?

According to clinical psychologist Dr. Jenny Yip, work-life balance may be an outdated term that misrepresents the reciprocal relationship between our work life and home life. We spend so much time at work and with coworkers—they're bound to overlap. Discover why this term may be misleading, and what to do instead.

Part of replacing work life balance with life awareness and integration starts with self talk, and psychology backed self care - Dr. Jenny Yip explains the relationship and shares tips for improving self talk and self care strategies in this video.

""The empathy deficit disorder is the result of an economic system built on the separation of work and home. This separation has devalued the most foundational form of empathy - the emotional, embodied, so-called affective empathy that is our birthright. As a result we have forgotten who we are... 

By aligning our new external reality with our innermost humanity, co-creation offers a solution to our empathy deficit disorder and an opportunity to unite our divided world. Empathy is that powerful.""","0","01:06:44",Education,{},NA,youtube,NA,Empathy deficit_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6TW1ZE6_pA,Depersonalization

In a profession as a nurse, stress is unavoidable, making stress management essential.  To reduce stress levels, individual nurses must take proactive steps like: 

▶️ Regulating their diet
▶️ Get enough sleep
▶️ Active stretching and exercising
▶️ Yoga, meditation, or deep breathing routines
▶️ Hobbies are a great way to unwind.
▶️ Share what you're experiencing with your peers
▶️ Journaling
▶️ Don't become too immersed in social networking sites.
▶️ Spend time with your near and dear ones whenever you get a chance
▶️ Don’t forget to love yourself. Try things that you love and make you happy. 
▶️ Nurses who handle stress well are more likely to enjoy their jobs and generate insights into helping others in emergencies.

How does real life connection influence your brain health and longevity?

The rise of algorithms has had a significant impact on our overall brain health and mental well-being. They work to direct your attention online and can disrupt how you interact with people, eventually interfering with how you learn, communicate, and engage with others. This makes it difficult to maintain a healthy balance between being online and fostering in-person connections.

To go further on this topic, I’m excited to have Colleen and Jason Wachob on our show today. They are the founders and co-CEO’s of Mind Body Green, an independent media brand dedicated to your well-being. They’re also the authors of the brand-new book, The Joy of Well-Being: A Practical Guide to a Happy, Healthy, and Long Life.

Technology can make your life easier in many ways. But it can also have a downside. The more it advances, the more tempting it can be to rely on algorithms to think for you. If you’re looking for a way to sort through the polarizing noise online and find information on nutrition and wellness to share with the people you love, this episode is for you.

Recognizing accomplishments,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcoUohKwVjA,Track Your Accomplishments at Work: A Game-Changing Technique,Joel Garfinkle,unknown,"656","8",0,"0","Track your accomplishments at work so you can represent your impact and value at a moment’s notice. Visit https://joelinspirationalspeaker.com to hire Joel to give this inspirational speech or corporate training for your team: “Career Advancement: Three Steps to Take Your Leadership to the Next Level.” 

Work to track your accomplishments on a daily basis so you can represent your value and impact to others. No one else in your workplace will do that for you—after all, you know what you do on a daily basis far better than anyone else does. Don’t leave them guessing. 

Consider the broader impact of your accomplishments, too. When others mention the benefits of something you achieved, make a note of their observations. If your boss mentions the value your accomplishment delivered, jot it down. Think of the impact of your achievements from a financial standpoint, and try to quantify it in that way. Instead of vague assertions about what you’ve contributed, you’ll be able to show measurable results.

When tracking your accomplishments at work, think about the less-measurable accomplishments, too, like your skill at building relationships with people across departments. Write down those successes that are less quantifiable but still have a tremendous impact on your company’s success.

Keep a file of all your notes about your successes, both large and small. Reflect on all your accomplishments for the work week each Friday, summarizing everything you achieved that week. Taking these steps will keep your contributions fresh in your mind, so you can speak to your value and achievements at a moment’s notice. 

Next time you’re waiting in an elevator with your boss’s boss—or that senior exec you’ve been wanting to meet—you won’t find yourself tongue-tied. Rather, you’ll be able to give that person a well-rounded picture of your most valuable contributions. When you have a check-in or annual review with your boss, you’ll be able to fully represent how you’ve been contributing. By advocating for yourself, you’ll prime others to advocate for you in turn, and you’ll set yourself up for promotional opportunities by enhancing your perception and visibility.

Visit https://joelinspirationalspeaker.com, learn how a motivational speech, corporate training or webinar by Joel will help all your team members to recognize and build from their achievements, maximizing their value to your organization. When your top talent enjoys greater job satisfaction, they’ll stay more loyal to your company as well, knowing they have an exciting future as part of your team.

Coping with work pressure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFy-EInCAro,Coping with stress and overwork in academia during COVID-19 | Professor Philippa Saunders,acmedsci,"5710","1087","15",0,"1","""I think I realised it was getting to me personally when I had a grant rejected and literally burst into tears. It was the loss of potential of that grant, and that it would have supported the salaries of two people, that really finally got to me.""

Professor Philippa Saunders is Professor of Reproductive Steroids at the University of Edinburgh, and a member of the Academy of Medical Sciences' Council. In this video she talks about stress, coping with lockdown, missing family, uncertainty and lack of control. She emphasises the importance of work-life separation and keeping in touch with colleagues, and how to build routines around exercise and things that give you pleasure. She also talks about the opportunities for talking with teams about their own work-life balance and a chance to talk honestly about career goals.

On Today's Episode:

Is your greatest enemy, or bully, in life actually yourself? Do you put yourself down, tell yourself, “You can’t do it,” or shut down your own dreams before even giving them a try?

They discuss the importance of turning up the volume on yourself in everything you do, why you have to have self-love, the incredible reward of always taking on challenges in pursuit of victory and change, how confidence will dramatically shape your life, the importance of staying true to your authentic self, and how to stay motivated each and every day in your relentless pursuit of greatness.

Being mentally exhausted can make us feel emotionally drained and overwhelmed, affect our motivation, and make it seem impossible to overcome our problems or complete necessary tasks.  It can lead to feelings or apathy and detachment and affect everything from our motivation to our self esteem.  Whether you are experiencing exhaustion at work, or in your personal life, this type of burnout can wreak havoc and lower our life-satisfaction.  Today we will look at the most common causes, symptoms and signs, and how to tell if it might be a concern, and if seeking a cure or treatment might be necessary for recovery.  I truly hope you find it healing and helpful.

I discuss the immensely powerful chemical that we all make in our brain and body: dopamine. I describe what it does and the neural circuits involved. I explain dopamine peaks and baselines, and the cell biology of dopamine depletion. I include 14 tools for how to control your dopamine release for sake of motivation, focus, avoiding and combating addiction and depression, and I explain why dopamine stacking with chemicals and behaviors inevitably leads to states of underwhelm and poor performance. I explain how to achieve sustained increases in baseline dopamine, compounds that injure and protect dopamine neurons including caffeine from specific sources. I describe non-prescription supplements for increasing dopamine—both their benefits and risks—and synergy of pro-dopamine supplements with those that increase acetylcholine.

Going from physician to patient following an accident on the same day, Dr. Bal Pawa realized the gap in our current medical system: The vital role of the mind-body connection and self-regulation. 
Her story teaches us the importance of taking control of our health and instilling techniques for self-care. One of Canada's leading Integrative physicians and co-founder of the Westcoast Women's Clinic, Dr. Pawa is also an author and speaker. She has been in practice for over 30 years using a unique, combined training as a Pharmacist, Medical Doctor, and Integrative Medicine practitioner which was instrumental in recognizing the need for Holistic Healthcare and disease prevention. Dr. Pawa obtained certification from Harvard Medical School in Mind-Body Medicine and also completed training under the direction of Dr. Deepak Chopra. She has made it her personal mission to empower, educate and inspire people to take charge of their health by cultivating a healthy, proactive mindset and bridging that gap.

This programme is focused on fair and equal recognition of the performance of our academics and is one of the pillars of our UG strategy. Recognition and Rewards is based on our belief that academia is more than just excellent research and that we need to consider aspects such as leadership, teaching qualities, societal impact and creativity when measuring academic success.

In February, we invited some of our academics to discuss the ways in which we assess research quality. It was a great opportunity to learn from each other as we were joined by colleagues from various faculties and departments. We collected some concrete ideas on how to measure research impact, which will now be taken on board as we look for ways to implement these suggestions. Thank you to everyone who joined us for this inspiring and constructive discussion!

We all have roles to play: manager, parent, friend, partner. But when one of these takes over, it’s normal to feel as if your life is out of balance. 

Absenteeism, low productivity and poor mental health - all are potential symptoms of poor work-life balance. So if you’re out of sorts, use these five tips to restore harmony.

1. Audit your time. Make a note of all your professional and personal commitments. Which ones are most valuable to you? Which are taking up too much of your time?

2. Improve your efficiency.  Limiting distractions will help you to work more productively and to focus on the tasks that really matter.

3. Add flexibility. Feeling trapped by strict working conditions? Try out the freedom of flexi-time, or working from home.

4. Find time for yourself. When you neglect your own well-being, you are no longer your best self in any part of your life. Don’t forget to set aside some “me time” every day.

5. Enjoy yourself. Time flies when you’re having fun, and the same applies to your work. An engaging workload will be more enjoyable, no matter how busy you are. Find meaning in your work and reap the rewards of job satisfaction!","0","00:02:02",Education,"{flexible,balance,wellbeing,lifestyle,efficient,""job satisfaction""}",NA,youtube,NA,Work-life balance strategies_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSSTdjwrlco,Personal achievement

How to elicit goals and convert them into observable, measurable goal statements
The goal heirarchy: Goal-Objective-Skills
How to use the 5 Ws to create a functional action plan
The basic principles of behavior modification and how to apply them to help clients achieve goals How to help clients achieve goals through successive approximations

The different types of learning styles and how to most effectively teach both to an individual and a mixed group
How temperament impacts learning and motivation 
How to modify your approach to accommodate learning styles and temperaments
Ways to modify the environment to increase energy and motivation
Goal Hierarchy
Goals  Objectives (Small Goals/Why)‏  Skills (How) & Knowledge (What/Why)‏
Goals are the overarching reason a person begins to do something.  
Often goals are broad and abstract. ""I want to be healthier.""  ""I want to be happy.""
Goals need to be broken down into manageable, meaningful, observable objectives.
Phrase goals as adding a positive instead of removing a negative.
One way to elicit goals is through the miracle question:  If you woke up tomorrow and you were _____ (i.e. your problem was resolved/goal was achieved) what would be different?
This gives you insight into the foundations of this particular persons symptoms/definition of the problem.
Objectives need to be put into measurable terms. Frequency, Intensity, Duration
Objectives are small goals that can usually be achieved in 1-3 monthsThey combine to make the ultimate goal a reality.  
Skills & Knowledge  If you believe that people do the best they can with the tools they have at any given time, then you understand that your client now needs to learn how to change.
The Hook, A.K.A. The 5 Ws 
Who is responsible for doing What, When, Where, Why and How
This is your client's action plan or map 
Who (your client)‏
What are they responsible for doing, when and where
Why are they doing it
How is it helping them meet their ultimate goal
Behavior Modification
Behavioran observable, measurable event
Reinforcer something that increases the frequency of a behavior
Reinforcing a quality that ensures the repetition of a behavior
Punishment something that decreases the frequency of a behavior
Punishing a quality that ensures the reduction of a behavior
Contingency If x then y
POINTS
We only do things in which the reinforcers (positive) outweigh the punishments (negative).
It is vital not only to ask why a person wants to change, but also why he/she does not want to change.

Behavior Strain  too much punishment/work without sufficient reward
Too long between initiation of behavior and reward
Using Behavior Modification
Treatment/Action Plan Activity
Write one of the most common reasons people come to see you
Turn that into an observable/measurable goal
Break the goal into 3-5 objectives that clearly state the 5 Ws
What is to be done
Who will do it
When will it be done
Why will it be done
Where will it be done
How (if applicable)‏
Motivation Multidimensional
Emotional—I want to
Intellectual-- I need to
Behavioral-- I am
Learning Styles
Global/Sequential
Start with an overview
Follow an outline
Auditory/Visual/Kinesthetic
Say it
Write it/Read it
Apply it
Temperament
http:keirsey.com
Extrovert/Introvert
Sensing(details)/Intuitive (big picture)‏
Thinking(""Rational"")/Feeling(""Emotional"")‏

Burnout and emotions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwUOWqR2JCA,How To Reverse Emotional Exhaustion And Relationship Burnout In Less Than 3 Weeks,Kristin Coaching,unknown,"8464","276",0,"29","***If you have a question, email is the best way to get a hold of me.  Since I'm getting so many responses on YouTube these days, I think it's best to gather all questions in one place so I can keep offering my support and advice.  Feel free to email at: kristin@kristincoaching.com

In this video, I talk about emotional exhaustion and relationship burnout which is not a topic you hear often, but it is a topic that effects thousands and thousands of relationships.  

Either you yourself have been in a relationship where exhaustion and burnout have occurred, or you know someone who has been experiencing this.

So, What is emotional exhaustion?

It is a chronic state of feeling depleted and drained emotionally, that usually results from continuous relationship stress. 

Sometimes our partners can be struggling with their own personal matters that we find ourselves overextended and overly emotionally invovled where their personal stress becomes our personal stress.
 

Who does emotional exhaustion and burnout effect?

It can effect everyone, but mainly occurs when you have exceeded your capacity to tolerate emotional stress.

Many of us feel it, even when we’re not aware that we’ve exhausted our emotional reserves.

It can also be manifested in both physical symptoms and psychologically symptoms.
 
Signs that might be experiencing relationship burnout:

- Fatigue
- insomnia
- Crying easily (Overly Emotional)
- Illness or physical symptoms
- Detachment
- Irritability or anger
- Lack of motivation
- Hopelessness
 
How to solve it? 

We owe it to ourselves to take steps to replenish our energy source and take care of ourselves.  We need to make sure we are functioning at the highest level possible before we can help others.  

Otherwise we won’t be able to provide our spouses and significant others with the love and care they need and deserve.

I also have a video on fixing a boring relationship this should give you some good advice on what to do: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCT2BwoE-Nc&t=55s

It takes about 18 days for new habits to start forming, so when we talk about what you can do to solve emotional exhaustion, you need to be doing these actions for at least 18 days straight in order for it to become a habit. 

Self Care! (Take a long walk, habitually, Hang out with people (new and old friends).

Change your mindset: 

Emotional exhaustion can be partly a result of our mindset and mental attitude that have towards life. 

 It is important not to be hard on yourself and have too many expectations that you cannot meet.  You will most likely feel emotionally depleted if you put too much expectation on yourself and have too many tasks to do at once.

Talk to your significant other about what is going on for you.  Often times we put more pressure on ourselves when we told this emotional burnout and exhaustion by ourselves and sometimes just talking to our partners about it can be freeing.  

Also, it is a sign of a healthy relationship when you can come together to problem solve this situation and figure out a way where both of you are taking care of yourselves the best you can so you can have the healthiest relationship possible.

Most people are genetically gifted with empathy; however, some have to learn this skill. For instance, therapists are taught 'empathy' before they can attend to clients.

Do you have the belief that you have what it takes to show up for yourself on a daily basis, accomplish the task you’ve set out to complete, and let the momentum take your business, body, relationships and mindset to a new level?

Or do you struggle to envision it at this time?

Research consistently confirms that our sense of self-efficacy will predict short-term and long-term success in behaviour change. 

Ultimately behaviour drives performance the results you get

As a business, you’ll want to consistently develop your own self-efficacy.

3 things to start with 

1. Have a Vision for a better future 
2. Create a 90-day game plan
3. Consider the legacy you want to create


The famous psychologist Albert Bandura defined the concept of self-efficacy in 1986. In a seminal article from that same year, a group of researchers applied the concept of self-efficacy to health behaviour, separating it into two parts:

Outcome expectations: the “expectations about the outcomes that will result from one’s engaging in a behaviour.”

Efficacy expectations: the “expectations about one’s ability to engage in or execute the behaviour.”

In this video, I share 20 self care ideas and healthy habits that actually work.

The tips in this video are designed to be relaxing and calming in the moment (absolutely wonderful for a pamper routine, self love routine, detox or self care sunday) but are also really great for your health, now and in the future!

Self care rituals are wonderful for everyone, and of course the activities in this list also fit perfectly into a minimalist lifestyle. If you want to know how to relax, it's also important to know what it is you truly need. Because we are all different. How can you really pamper yourself? What makes you feel amazing? It's time to discover these things.

Minimalism and self care actually have some things in common, if you ask me. And this video is actually a short excerpt from Simple Happy Zen's online course, called In Love With Your Life - 20 Weeks to simplify your life and amplify your happiness. If you want to improve your life through simplifying, check out the course here: https://simplehappyzen.teachable.com/p/in-love-with-your-life

How you do practice self-care and self love? What do you do on a self care morning? Let me know in the comments!

Lots of love,

This talk explores how our singular mission should be collective wellness, why now is the time to pursue it, and how the journey will offer the healing our world has desired for centuries. Chloe is an internationally acclaimed social designer, artist, and humanitarian. Fueled by an unshakable reverence for all life, her practice demands dignity for all, and centers the reimagining of societal systems to guarantee global well-being. Hakim-Moore designed and leads NEXT Memphis: a $32 million initiative of Porter-Leath to increase access to high quality early childhood education for all families in Shelby County.

Her past projects include: leading the operations of First 8 Memphis; partnering with the National Institutes of Health to serve persons with disabilities in Trinidad and Tobago; and supporting refugees and immigrants through designing citizenship attainment and food entrepreneurship opportunities.

Resilience and stress,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkwWQtn5_wg,"Heartmath Coaching for building Resilience to Stress, Anxiety and Depression",hatson dot coach,unknown,"1345","22",0,"0","Do you suffer from anxiety, anger or regret? Are you under pressure to perform and work or at home? Do you find yourself stuck in negative feelings and struggling to sleep?

The media constantly reports that stress and overwhelm are out of hand, with over 75% of adults suffering from chronic stress every year.
The world is changing faster than ever before, but our brains don’t like change. To our nervous system, change means danger, and danger puts us on high alert.

Nowadays we call this stress, but it’s an ancient survival mechanism that isn’t designed to be sustained for long periods of time.

When you are stressed, your heart beats differently to when you are relaxed and feeling good. This can be measured using a technique called Heart Rate Variability. 

And by using biofeedback, the scientists at Heartmath have developed tools and techniques that retrain the brain to respond to change and threat of modern living in a healthier and more sustainable way.

Because when you respond to situations in a calmer, more intuitive manner, you get better results from decisions and relationships, which leaves you feeling better, sleeping without regret and living a healthier and happier life.
Using Heartmath’s patented technology and your smartphone, I train your nervous system to relax in situations that would have previously stressed you or made you anxious.

With over 20 years of success in large corporations, Emergency Services, Professional Sports and the Armed Forces, Heartmath is the most effective method for reducing stress and anxiety in a busy world.

With my Heartmath Coaching, you will learn to regulate yourself when under stress and pressure, using a sensor that connects to your phone and trains you to maintain positive states of mind, using your heart rhythms as a guide.

You can learn this using my online course or with one to one coaching calls.

You then take these techniques out in to the real world to help you deal better with awkward people, stressful situations such as presentations and interviews, feeling good and able to sleep well every night.

I’m a Licensed Heartmath Coach who has been helping people feel and perform better for over 10 years. From stress, anxiety, burnout and sleep issues to athletes and business leaders wanting to perform at their best, in just a few sessions you’ll notice the difference and be back to your best in four or five weeks.

So when you’re ready to respond better to life’s challenges, book a discovery call now.

You're lifting weights. The first time feels easy, but each lift takes more and more effort until you can’t continue. Inside your arms, the muscles responsible for the lifting have become unable to contract. What’s going on? Christian Moro explains how exactly our muscles operate, and what causes them to become fatigued.

Empathy deficit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM3KvUYE23M,Do You Have Empathy Deficit Disorder?,Mountain Creek Church of Christ,unknown,"1537","4",0,"0","Douglas LaBier (psychologist) labeled Empathy Deficit Disorder: unable to step outside yourself and tune in to what other people experience, especially those who feel, think and believe differently from yourself. EDD is a source of personal conflicts, of communication breakdown in intimate relationships, and of adversarial attitudes - including hatred - towards groups of people who differ in their beliefs, traditions, values or ways of life from your own.
Take the man who told me that his wife always complained that he didn't spend enough time with their children; that she had most of the burden despite having a career of her own. ""Yeah, I see her point,"" he said in a neutral voice, ""but I need time for my sports activities on the weekends. I'm not going to give that up. And at night I'm tired, I want to veg out."" As we talked further, it became clear to me that he simply didn't experience what his wife's world was like for her, on the inside. His own reality -- specifically, his own needs -- were his only reality.
Vine's: splanchnizomai: ""to be moved as to one's inwards (splanchna), to be moved with compassion, to yearn with compassion,""

I. For physical infirmities
 A. Two blind men sitting by road in Jericho
  1. Matt 20:34 Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him.
 B. Before feeding 5,000
  1. Matt 14:14 When He went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and felt compassion for them and healed their sick.
 C. Again before feeding 4,000
  1. Matt 15:32 And Jesus called His disciples to Him, and said, ""I feel compassion for the people, because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry, for they might faint on the way.""
 D. Jesus wants us to have compassion for others' needs
  1. James 2:15-17 If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, 16 and one of you says to them, ""Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,"" and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that? 17 Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.

II. For People Struggling With Sin and Satan
 A. Luke 7:44-48
 B. For sinners returning home
  1. Luke 15:20 So he got up and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion for him, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.
 C. God wants us to have compassion on sinners
  1. James 5:20 let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.

III. For Large Masses of People
 A. Matt 9:35-36 Jesus was going through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. 36 Seeing the people, He felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd.
 B. How do you feel about masses of people with no hope and without God in the world? 
  1. Phil 4:5 Let your gentle spirit be known to all men.

IV. Do you wonder if Jesus is willing to help you?
 A. Do you doubt Jesus' ability to help you?
  1. Mark 9:22-23 ""It has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!"" 23 And Jesus said to him, "" 'If You can?' All things are possible to him who believes.""
 B. Do you doubt his willingness?
  1. Mark 1:41 Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, and said to him, ""I am willing; be cleansed.""","0","00:26:31",Education,"{""church of Christ"",gospel,sermon,preach,Bible,Christian,Chattanooga,truth,God,Jesus,Lord,empathy,""empathy deficit disorder"",compassion,bowels,sick,disabled,blind,leprosy}",NA,youtube,NA,Empathy deficit_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM3KvUYE23M,Depersonalization

Promoting interpersonal connections,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrf6eHdmr4c,The Interpersonal Gap communication model,Bridgingagap,unknown,"340","3",0,"0","The Interpersonal Gap is an Interpersonal Communication Model by John Wallen.  The model describes the interpersonal communication process from the intent of person A as it passes through internal  filters where it is decoded into an action.  The Action (verbal and nonverbal behaviors) passes through person B’s internal filters where it is decoded (some form of thought -interpretations and judgments- which produces primarily an emotion).

                                             Key Points

         -  Intentions and Impacts are Private only know to persons A & B.      
            The Action is public.
         -  We only know people by our interpretations of their actions.
         -  Meanings are within people.  Meanings are not in words.  Our 
             words are only translations of our intent (sometimes we get it 
             wrong!).
         -  Because our judgments and interpretations come from our
             experience, they say more about us then they do about the
             person we’re judging.

The Interpersonal Gap is fundamental to how we communicate with others.  The more we are aware of our intentions and how we are impacted by the actions of others, the more opportunity we have to choose what thoughts, feelings and wants we will communicate to improve clarity and understanding in the relationship.","0","00:07:06",Education,"{""Interpersonal Communication""}",NA,youtube,NA,Promoting interpersonal connections_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrf6eHdmr4c,Depersonalization

In this video I explore why work life balance is a lie (yep, total BS). I can’t tell you how many articles and books I’ve read about work life balance for women and  , and work life balance for working mothers - but the thing is all those work life balance tips don’t work.

It can be so hard to stop focusing on someone when you’re worried about them or to detach yourself emotionally from someone you love when you feel like they’re making poor life choices. But this is codependent behavior and it’s crucial to create healthy boundaries in your relationships and find a way to emotionally detach in a loving and supportive way.  
 
Today you’ll learn the 3 steps to practice loving detachment and stop your codependency.

In this 1.5-minute video, Dr Christo Karuna explains:
– Burnout: an inability to cope with chronic psychological stress at work
– ...due to the perception of insufficient resources to cope with job demands
– Maslach Burnout Inventory is a widely used instrument
– It captures emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation ...
– ... and a feeling of reduced personal accomplishment
– The meta-analysis found a wide range of burnout from 6% to 32%
– Intervention needs to focus on interaction between system and individual
– When GPs feel heard they feel supported by the practice and/or system
– Increased perceived resources vs perceived demands may address burnout

It’s an automatic response to overwhelming danger - or at least perceived danger. When fighting your way out or running away seems impossible, the brain turns on the freeze response as the last resort.  

This is not something conscious. It’s not something you plan or choose; it’s something that your deep limbic brain triggers much faster than thinking. And it can be hard to break out of the freeze response. So in this video, we’re going to talk about one of the things I do in session with my clients to help them work through it.

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction. 
And deeper than all of that, the Gospel of Jesus Christ orients my personal worldview and sense of security, peace, hope, and love https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe

#workhard    #motivationalspeech #disciplinedthinking 
In the realm of productivity, we embark,
With a mindset focused and a fiery spark.
No more delays, no more idle play,
It's time to work, to seize the day.

The tasks await, the goals are set,
A journey of progress, we won't forget.
With determination and a purpose clear,
We dive into action, banishing all fear.

Time is precious, a valuable treasure,
We manage it wisely, in every measure.
No more distractions, no wasted hours,
We harness our focus, unlocking our powers.

Challenges may arise, obstacles may appear,
But we press on, fueled by vision and cheer.
Through effort and perseverance, we strive,
Embracing the struggle, we come alive.

The path may be tough, the workload immense,
But we rise to the occasion, our strength immense.
With dedication and commitment in our core,
We conquer the tasks, achieving even more.

Procrastination's grip, we firmly break,
As we embark on this journey, for our dreams' sake.
With diligence and discipline, we make a stand,
Embracing the call to action, hand in hand.

So let us rally our spirits, and ignite the flame,
For it's time to work, to embrace the game.
With passion and purpose, we'll make our mark,
Leaving a legacy, as we embark.

It's time to work, to reach new heights,
To strive for excellence, with all our might.
Together we'll conquer, overcome, and soar,
For it's in the realm of work that we truly roar.

Coping with work pressure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3CU2kOBt3s,Coping With Uncertainty,MindToolsVideos,unknown,"96904","1982",0,"40","To learn more about coping with uncertainty and dealing with stress, discover our range of tools at: https://www.mindtools.com/pages/main/newMN_TCS.htm?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=copingwithuncertainty&utm_content=description

The world is an uncertain place. Things change fast, and it can be difficult to see what's coming next.

But with the right approach, you can make things easier for yourself, learn to be comfortable with uncertainty, and be prepared for whatever the future brings.

Here are six simple strategies for coping when things get messy.

Fear is a natural reaction to uncertainty, but you can't let it rule you.

Worrying about the future is pointless. So don't ask, ""What if?"" Ask, ""What will I do if?""

Knowing how you will react if things do go badly takes a lot of the sting out of the worry. Feeling out of control can be scary. 

So, instead of fretting about the things you can't affect, focus on the things you can. Work out what you can do, and do it.

You'll probably feel better for knowing you're doing something useful. Plan for various possibilities, not just the outcome you think is most likely.

Build in contingencies so that, whatever happens, you're in a solid position to deal with whatever comes next. Being agile means you're able to respond quickly to differing needs or adapt to changing circumstances.

Think about developing new skills, which would not only make you more valuable, but give you new career options too.

At the same time, be alert. Stay on top of changes that could affect you and your business. The sooner you know about something, the quicker you can react!

Uncertainty can cause anxiety and stress, which can damage your health and get you stuck in a vicious circle. Exercise helps clear stress hormones from your body, while meditation and mindfulness can help you relax and reduce anxiety.

Talking to someone you trust can also help you find perspective – a problem shared is a problem halved.

One of the greatest causes of unhappiness and stress in uncertain times can be comparing how we think things ""should"" be with how they are.

But ask yourself, ""According to whom?"" Often, the answer is ""nobody."" It's always good to have goals, but make them your aspirations, not your expectations.

If you can accept uncertainty for what it is, prepare yourself for various outcomes, address your worries head-on, and manage your personal stress levels, you'll cope much better in ""interesting"" times.

And, hopefully, put yourself in a position to deal with whatever comes your way.","0","00:04:01",Education,"{""stress management"",uncertainty,change,readiness,prepare,challenge}",NA,youtube,NA,Coping with work pressure_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3CU2kOBt3s,Emotional exhaustion

When you feel like you have nothing left to give, each day feels as if you’re running on fumes. In this message, Pastor Rick Warren takes a look at the setbacks in Elijah’s life, and the 10 warning signs of an emotionally empty tank. You’ll learn what steps God uses to refill your life with hope, joy, and love. Discover how to find rest, release, and refocusing through Christ.

How many great teachers and administrators leave the profession because no one took the time to recognize their greatness? 

Educators – teachers and administrators, alike – are hurting.  We lose half of our teachers within six years and half of our principals within three. This constant turnover in education costs us financially, academically and emotionally. Nowadays, too many schools, districts and organizations suffer from major burnout and fatigue. 

That’s where Danny comes in. He will energize the educators in your audience, remind them of their leadership importance and provide them with tools to help them constantly improve their practices. 

 “Danny’s presentations were engaging, full of energy and fun…but most importantly they were immediately useful.” – Richard P. Pierucci, Associate Superintendent 

In the last ten years, Danny has spoken on over 2,000 stages and reached tens of thousands of educators worldwide.  He has turned countless hostile and disgruntled teachers and principals into passionate and collegial leaders, always focused on how to help your students achieve more.

And he can help you, too.  

 “Not only did I leave the training invigorated and inspired, but I also gained strategies to improve my instruction through increased student engagement.” – MandeeMarie Jones (Teacher)

“Danny brought the enthusiasm and energy level of Tony Robbins combined with the wisdom and knowledge of Dr. Benjamin Spock.” – Holly Bauer (Parent Board Member)

“We all left so excited, looking forward to the start of school, and empowered to always be a positive influence in the lives of our students.” – Carol Berg (Educator)

So take a look at more of Danny's speaking videos as well as video testimonials from past clients: https://www.youtube.com/DannyBrassell. Learn how you can partner with Danny to bring value to you and solve a huge pain point for your audience.

Job satisfaction and burnout,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTkm3qFmobY,How To Avoid Corporate Burnout And It's Devastating Impact On Your Life,Dianne Sullivan,unknown,"256","22",0,"5","Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand prime minister recently resigned citing burnout as one of the reasons.
Corporate burnout is a state of chronic exhaustion and lack of motivation that results from prolonged exposure to high levels of stress in the workplace. It can manifest as physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion, as well as a sense of cynicism and detachment from one's work. If left unchecked, corporate burnout can lead to serious health problems, such as depression and anxiety, as well as decreased productivity and job satisfaction.
#burnout #worklifebalance #selfcare 

Top causes;
1. Overwork: If you're consistently working long hours and taking on too much, it's only a matter of time before you start feeling burnt out.
2. Lack of control: Feeling like you have no control over your workload or the direction of your career can be a major source of stress.
3. Unclear expectations: Not knowing what's expected of you or having unrealistic expectations placed on you can lead to burnout.
4. Poor work-life balance: If you're constantly sacrificing your personal life for your job, it can take a toll on your well-being.
5. Toxic work environment: If your workplace is filled with negativity, conflict, and a lack of support, it can be extremely draining.

Empowerment self at work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuA63RHngHA,Self-management: empowering employees - Docu - 2015,vpro documentary,unknown,"4398","58",0,"9","Are self-managed teams the future of our workplace? The role of the manager, and especially the middle management, is under fire. Three organizations show how providing space for self-management lead to empowered employees. The concept of empowering employees and trusting them to decide when and how they will work, without any middle management required to check on them, makes its way in our way of working.

Original title: Het einde van de manager

The classic business as we know it: with many managers, syrupy decision-making, protocols and overhead; does not seem to work anymore. Many companies are struggling with high absenteeism. Employees are unmotivated and that is at the expense of productivity. But there are other possibilities.

Our economy shifted to a knowledge economy and our work does not necessarily have to be done between 9 and 5. New forms of organization and management fit in with this. But how do you do that and what does it deliver?

VPRO Backlight is looking for the company of the future, where the manager as we know it has disappeared and where people decide for themselves how and when they work without being checked from above.

In the construction company Kesselaar & Zn. in Alkmaar, the employees arrange everything themselves. The company, unlike many other construction companies, profits, works cheaper and delivers on time.

At the Belgian Federal Public Service Social Security in Brussels, (comparable to the Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs) the 1100 employees determine themselves when they work and how they do so. The managers are now called coaches and they are judged by 'their' people.

And while the Dutch National Police is currently in the middle of one of the most radical reorganisations ever, experiments are being carried out on the work floor with 'control-poor' teams. The idea: fewer protocols and more security.

Workplace cynicism,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVlL9TnvphA,Understanding Job Burnout - Dr. Christina Maslach,IT Revolution,unknown,"40783","533",0,"29","DOES19 London — Burnout is a hot topic in today's workplace, given its high costs for both employees and organizations. What causes this problem? And what can be done about it? Empirical findings show that burnout is largely a function of the social environment in which people work. The key sources lie in 6 critical areas of mismatch between the person and the job. This talk will review major new insights into the causes and effects of this problem, and will discuss the most promising strategies for dealing effectively with it.

About Me:
I’m Emma McAdam. I’m a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, and I have worked in various settings of change and growth since 2004. My experience includes juvenile corrections, adventure therapy programs, wilderness therapy programs, an eating disorder treatment center, a residential treatment center, and I currently work in an outpatient therapy clinic.  

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction. 
And deeper than all of that, the Gospel of Jesus Christ orients my personal worldview and sense of security, peace, hope, and love https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe

My name is Paul and I discovered I have Aspergers at age 30.
If you're new you can check out a playlist of some of my most popular videos here: https://www.youtube.com/c/aspergersfromtheinside/playlists

Yes, I know, I don't look autistic. That's exactly why I started this blog, because if I didn't show you, you would never know.

As the name suggests, this channel is devoted to giving you insight into the world of Aspergers.
This blog started off being just my story, but I've learned SO MUCH about my own condition
from meeting others on the Autism Spectrum that now I make sure to feature their stories as well.

I've come a long way in my own personal journey.
Now I'm sharing what I've found so you don't have to learn it the hard way too.

-----------------------------------------------

// WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS BLOG

You can expect me to get to the point with concise useful information.
I focus on what is most important and don't shy away from difficult topics.

The best way to learn about Autism is to see it in real life ( i.e. via the stories of many, many people on the spectrum).

In this channel I endeavour to show you what Autism and Aspergers look like in real people and to also give you some insight as to what's happening on the inside.
I upload a new video every weekend with some bonus content thrown in mid-week too.
There's always new stuff coming through so be sure to check back and see what you've missed. (Is this where I'm supposed to tell you to hit that subscribe button?)

Topics Include:
- What is Aspergers/Autism?
- Aspie Tips, coping strategies, and advice on common issues
- Learning Emotional Intelligence (this is my special interest!)
- Autism in real life: stories from special guests

Everything I do is and endeavour to go deeper and take you 'behind the scenes' to understand what may, at first glance, seem 'odd'.
oh, and I love busting stereotypes and turning preconceptions upsidedown :)

-----------------------------------------------

// ABOUT ME

I discovered I have aspergers at the age of thrity.
It has been my life's mission to understand these funny creatures we call humans.
My special interest is a combination of emotional intelligence, psychology, neuroscience, thinking styles, behaviour, and motivation. (I.e. what makes people tick)
My background is in engineering and I see the world in systems to be analysed.
My passion is for taking the incredibly complex, deciphering the pattern, and explaining it very simply.
My philosophy is that blogging is an adventure best shared.

-----------------------------------------------

// EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING

I also run autism friendly online emotional intelligence training. So if you like my direct, systematic style, and would like to improve your own emotional intelligence skills, check it out here:

I explain the neural (brain) circuits that underlie goal setting and pursuit. Then I describe nine science-supported tools anyone can apply toward their goals. I explain when and how to use goal visualization, when to use multitasking and how to use specific rewards to improve the likelihood of reaching your goals. I also explain why envisioning failures and their consequences are effective and how to set goals of the appropriate level of challenge. I also explain how the molecule dopamine is used to gauge our progress toward milestones and long-term overarching goals and how to leverage dopamine for goal pursuit. Finally, I explain a unique tool called 'space-time bridging' that can be used to support all aspects of goal setting, assessment, and pursuit. This episode ought to be useful for anyone seeking to improve their performance in work, school, exercise, athletics, or personal development.

-- Why Burnout Culture Is Dying --

What is burnout? 

Believe it or not, burnout isn’t just being tired or worn out. Burnout is actually a trauma state.

In fact, when examined under fMRI, the brains of people diagnosed with burnout show similar changes to those who have experienced childhood trauma.

Burnout causes actual, tangible, physical changes to your brain.

And that’s why burnout culture is dying.

Because we as people are seeing the fallacy of just working harder and harder. 

We are seeing how it is robbing us of our health, our happiness and how “success” just continues to be elusive. No matter how hard you work, the goal posts keep moving further away.

In this video, I talk about all the ways in which burnout culture influences us, and why it needs to stop.

Watch the video for more and make sure to leave me a comment to let me know how this landed for you.

Alex Wuqi Zhang, Ting-Han Lin, Xuan Zhao, Sarah Sebo

CHI 2023: The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems
Session: Fostering Meaningful Virtual Connections

Despite the clear benefits that social connection offers to well-being, strangers in close physical proximity regularly ignore each other due to their tendency to underestimate the positive consequences of social connection. In a between-subjects study (N = 49 pairs, 98 participants), we investigated the effectiveness of a humanoid robot, a computer screen, and a poster at stimulating meaningful, face-to- face conversations between two strangers by posing progressively deeper questions. We found that the humanoid robot facilitator was able to elicit the greatest compliance with the deep conversation questions. Additionally, participants in conversations facilitated by either the humanoid robot or the computer screen reported greater happiness and connection to their conversation partner than those in conversations facilitated by a poster. These results suggest that technology-enabled conversation facilitators can be useful in breaking the ice between strangers, ultimately helping them develop closer connections through face-to-face conversations and thereby enhance their overall well-being.

Regular cynicism may result in organizational demise. It is likely that half of your colleagues are cynics and feel some level of disengagement.

The last five years have seen the collapse of the U.S. banking system, a bank bailout, S&P's lowering of the U.S. credit rating, an implosion of Europe's banking system, and regular reports on multiple wars. 

Add to that daily worries of the average worker - the treat of being laid off, increased work loads, decreased wages, and plummeting retirement funds - and it's easy to see how cynicism has securely lodged itself in the psyche of the American worker. 

Cynicism is alive and well. If it were a stock, you'd be buying it right now. And it's currently positioned to make huge gains if it goes unchecked. 

There is no such thing as a healthy amount of cynicism, because it has an enduring capacity to infect others.

Cynicism Kills is a campaign to stop cynicism in the business world. This cause was created by Strativity Group, Inc. - a global customer experience research and consulting firm, which helps clients create delightful customer experiences and execute profitable customer strategies.

Many people are searching for the 'holy grail' of detachment.  It is an emotional experience that eludes so many of us.  Detachment is being able to be ourselves while staying connected to others and not be pushed and pulled by the emotional dynamics in a relationship, family, or group.   Jerry Wise, a life and relationships coach, presents nine ways to achieve detachment.  Enmeshment, codependency, caretaking, and fused relationships require us to move to greater detachment for our recovery.  Jerry Wise brings another message of self-differentiation to help those in recovery and to guide viewers into greater maturity and emotional freedom.  Jerry Wise, MA, MS, CLC has over 150 videos on You Tube.

Making this a most powerful quantum rejuvenation meditation indeed. The exact frequency settings within this range will be kept to my self making sure that the quantum rejuvenation formula is not duplicated and is a theta realms exclusive brainwave meditation.

OTHER FEATURES: This formula is also utilizing a combination of 9 TONES - RESONATING AT DIFFERENT FREQUENCY SETTINGS.

40 HZ + 80 HZ + 126 HZ + 136 HZ + 728 HZ + 528 HZ + 741 HZ + 852 HZ

EVEN WITH THE INFO PROVIDED there is allot of customization that is being kept to my self. There is absolutely no way to replicate this formula 100% - so i proudly present the most powerful quantum rejuvenation formula from theta realms.

THERE IS NO NEED TO LIST A MASSIVE LIST OF POTENTIAL HEALING AND RESTORATIVE AND REJUVENATING EFFECTS - ONE JUST HAS TO LAY DOWN AND RELAX AND ENJOY THE MEDITATION - EVEN ONE HOUR IN DEEP STATE WITH THIS FORMULA WILL REJUVENATE MOST PEOPLE WITH NEW ENERGY. IMPROVE MUSCLE RECOVERY AND ENERGY BALANCING EFFECTS.

Some define him as an expert institutional investor, while others know him as a large scale installation artist, avid outdoorsman, professor, decision strategist, coach, business leader, mindfulness extremist, author, speaker, daredevil or Guinness world record holder. In his talk, Stephen explains that what truly defines him aren't titles, but an approach to decision making that transformed him from someone who struggled with simple tasks to a guy who is continuously achieving even his most ambitious dreams.

For thirty years, he has applied cognitive science to investing, business and life. The result has been the turnaround of numerous institutional businesses, career best returns for managers who have adopted his methods, the development of a $1.25 billion dollar hedge fund and a rapidly shrinking bucket list.
Mr. Duneier teaches graduate courses on Decision Analysis in UCSB’s College of Engineering. His book, AlphaBrain is due for release in early 2017 from Wiley & Sons.
Through Bija Advisors, he helps business leaders improve performance by applying proven, proprietary decision-making methods to their own processes.
His artwork has been featured around the world and is represented by the Sullivan Goss Gallery. As Commissioner of the League of Professional Educators, Duneier is using cognitive science to alter the landscape of American education. He is the former Head of Currency Option Trading at Bank of America and Emerging Markets at AIG International.

Lack of empathy at work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSHjtt5HlQs,Signs they lack empathy.,FinelyRevealed,unknown,"149740","2291",0,"1284","People expect others they think are similar to them will behave as they do- and absent some disclosed condition or special situation that expectation is understandable.  Included in this is the ability to empathize. When someone has expressed caring and feelings for you and has exhibited certain behaviors that support their expression of feelings it can be a shock to you when you see that a person lacks empathy. True empathy is hard to manufacture in a believable way. In this video we give specific examples of a showing of a lack of empathy. The experts say if you encounter this in another person with whom you have become close to who has not explained or disclosed some other condition (because lack of empathy can accompany other conditions) and whom you believe to be 'normal' - it is a red flag. It means you should explore the possibility that they are disordered and create distance.  

If you wonder what it feels like to have empathy watch this:

We probably all 'label' people unnecessarily and sometimes improperly.  Watch this to get the baseline of what you have experienced or believe about a person and then match it against the examples:https://youtu.be/RK5Pb2nHjHY

 Empathy and its lack is a sign of a narcissist, psychopath and/or sociopath. Other clues are in this video:

The first thing that you need to do to practice empathy is take a step back and learn to listen. Don’t respond too quickly, take time to digest and process the information.

The next step is to be aware of your emotions.

Research shows that to practice empathy, you either need to be in a neutral state or the same state as the person who is coming to you.

The last technique is taking the opposite perspective. 

Try to take the other person's perspective and argue against yourself a little bit. Try to challenge your initial assumptions. 

Practicing empathy will greatly improve your leadership and the employee experience in your organization.

Emotional exhaustion is caused by a long period of constant life stress, whether from personal stress at home or stress related to work.  Understanding what your own triggers are will go a long way to helping you understand how to manage your exhaustion. 

Disclaimer: Emotional burnout will differ from person to person. So, it is important to note that what might be stressful for one person, may be more manageable for somebody else. If you can relate to any of the signs in this video, always speak to your doctor or healthcare professional and seek medical advice if necessary. Emotional exhaustion can be difficult to manage so don’t suffer in silence.

1- Breathwork- Also known as mindful breathing, or keeping the focus on one's breath, even for a minute, can assist in eliminating signs of stress and anxiety. Conscious breathing is the simplest form of meditation and one of the best methods to practice living in the present moment. With mindful breathing, you are making a decision about how you want to live which is also a self-care practice.

2- Meditation- Being occupied implies being surrounded by people most of the time, whether it’s at work, home, school, social events, etc. Spending quality time with others is essential but when was the last time you took 10 minutes to yourself? Meditation provides you with that quality 'me time. It gives you a space to practice and engages in loving yourself.

3- Movement- Exercise is important to a wholesome life, but I also believe that you must pick exercises that make you feel good. People go to gyms or classes strictly because they think it would provide them with the desired body shape. I believe doing exercises that one enjoys like yoga, Pilates, and weight training make a difference in willpower and mind which results in the best outputs.

4- Beauty Rituals- The skin is your protection and it needs love! I opt to take good care of my skin by utilizing organic products for my body and face and body. It must have non-harming elements, and that rejuvenate the skin from the inside out. Pamper yourself in your full skincare habit and offer your mind and skin the care it demands. Exfoliate, Soak, Put on a face mask, Moisturize and do everything you have on your skincare routine list. Or check out my YouTube and Instagram videos. Wholly engaging yourself in this practice can be very calming because it gives you a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. 

5- Focus on what's going on in my system, food, and thoughts.
Dividing your feeds and snacks throughout the day is an incredible layout of self-care via nourishment. Daily dining will assist in keeping your metabolism functional and uphold the ideal blood sugar levels and save you from munching later in the day. Listening to your body is also a kind of self-care technique. Your body is the conveyance that takes you through good and bad times. Reserve a minute or two daily to hear out your body. Ask yourself if there is any sense of pain, anxiety, or fear regarding anything to the extent that you are gripping your jaws. Do you need a break from a couple of chores today and get to sleep before time? Give this blessing of purposeful reexamination to your body and mind.

6- Journaling- When you were a teenager, you might have maintained a diary that was always hidden beneath your bed. It was a spot to acknowledge your battles and anxieties. One of the best manners to cope with any overwhelming sentiment is to discover a wholesome way to describe yourself. This makes a journal a beneficial piece of equipment for managing your cognitive health.

7- Connecting with someone I love- Psychologists believe mental fitness ranges from depression to recovery. Discussions often emphasize these extremes, omitting the standard ground. If you have ever felt like you are not performing at 100%, you are facing a crisis concentrating and your sense of provocation has dulled. That is when you need someone to connect with. 

8- Visualize before sleep- Visualization can be an influential method to enable you to unwind, reduce anxiety, and even fall asleep. Rather than focusing on your stressful, fearful images, visualizing

Today we’ll share 5 tips and tricks to help you reach higher customer satisfaction.

Customer satisfaction is a term we all understand at a basic level: a customer comes to your company for a product and leaves satisfied. A satisfied customer will recommend you to friends and most importantly, return for more purchases. So how do you make sure your customers are happy? 

Listen to that customer feedback
Listening to your customers, actually, actively listening to your customers, is crucial in any business. You've got to take their feedback seriously and do something about it and not just be like ""thank you"". This is literally about improving your business, it can help you identify areas where you need to improve and make changes to get higher customer satisfaction. 

Respond to customer complaints quickly and effectively
Handling customer complaints might look as tricky as taming a lion, but what if complaints aren’t bad for your business? What if they could be a source of helpful information and an opportunity to learn, develop, and gain loyal customers? Have you ever thought of it that way?

You see, we all know that no business likes complaints, and no one is thrilled to deal with them. However, it’s very important to address it quickly and professionally since this can help resolve the issue and prevent the customer from taking their business elsewhere. 

Provide high-quality products and services that EXCEED customer expectations
This will sound very basic, but it's true: The best way to improve customer satisfaction is to provide high-quality products and services that meet or exceed customer expectations. By providing high-quality products and services you are literally eliminating customer complaints and returns by a whole tone. 

A significant part of this point is customer expectations. Expectations can vary depending on whether, for example, you over-promoted your product and it's overhyped, or the customer paid for a premium, shiny product, and when they received it they couldn’t overlook the cheap packaging. Either way, when there is a gap between expectations and reality: your customers will tell you about it. And if you want to make them happy, ensure that the gap is as small as possible or even exceeds their expectations. 

Show appreciation to your customers 
Showing appreciation to your customers is like thanking them for their business or offering them special promotions or discounts. 

Share the stories of your customers on your channels
I’m sure your customers will love any gifts that you send their way. However, if you’re selling to other businesses, your customers will love it even more if you tell your audience about them. Share their success stories in case studies, give them shout-outs on social media, and mention them in your company newsletter. 

So, are you ready to go and increase your customer satisfaction? I think you’re ready, you know all that you’ve got to know to get started and reach higher levels of customer satisfaction.

As we get older, we lose mitochondria, the energy-producing engines in the cells. And because of that,  we produce less adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the molecule that provides energy to cells throughout our bodies.

Other causes of fatigue, such as medication side effects or chronic illnesses like depression or heart disease, can make you feel tired or sluggish.

But age- and disease-related factors aren't the only things that suck your energy.

Lifestyle habits also play a part in fatigue.

Resilience building,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CFA91HlUw,Building Resilience with Michele Cushatt,Chrystal Evans Hurst,unknown,"5193","251",0,"22","It is okay to acknowledge when our life is hard. It is okay to accept that it may not immediately change. The goal is to focus on how we can grow in the midst of it all. Our false faith tells us if God is kind he will save us from the hurt. Truth tells us it’s in his kindness that he allows us to endure pain. And resiliency is the muscle he grows in us to help us endure.

Michele and I sat down to discuss how easy it is to expect God to rescue us from our hard circumstances rather than embracing them as an opportunity to learn. Yet, we can move from seeing struggles as losses to seeing them as opportunities to learn when we radically change how we view pain, develop the skill of resilience and shift our perspective of God’s role.

Join us as Michele shares how the unexpected hard circumstances in her life have helped her grow her faith and built her skill of resiliency.

This stress affects people in different ways. Take a moment to notice and accept your feelings. These are normal reactions to an abnormal situation. It is important to take time to care for our mental health during COVID-19 and other periods of heightened stress.

Avoid coping strategies that will make you feel worse and instead use strategies like talking about your experience, spending time with loved ones, getting your news from reliable sources and taking care of yourself physically, mentally, and spiritually. 

Remember, you are not alone. If there is violence in your home or if you are thinking of hurting yourself or others, talk to a trusted friend, family member or counselor or call your local emergency hotlines. There is help in your community.

It’s like you’re observing yourself and your thoughts. Things don’t seem real.

Derealization is defined as feeling unreal and detached but this time with respect to your surroundings and environment. In this case, you aren’t looking at yourself or feeling out of body, but your environment doesn’t seem real. It might seem like you’re in a dream.

Depersonalization derealization disorder tends to start in adolescence or early adulthood. It would be very unusual for someone to have the disorder for the first time in their 40’s or 50’s unless the symptoms are the result of something else. 

There are other things that can cause derealization or depersonalization where it is not a separate disorder. You can have these symptoms that come and go. Some things that can cause this are drug use. Marijuana is a big one. This can also happen with medications such as antidepressants.

Join us and learn what it takes begin promoting meaningful engagement and building communities around your brand in this episode of OnBrand!

“Empty engagement is just engagement for engagement’s sake. And unfortunately, we have come to associate engagement with attention, and they are not the same thing. At least not when we’re building community. Just because you have someone’s eyeballs doesn’t mean you are meaningfully engaging them.”
– Carrie Melissa Jones, Author and Community Strategist

Welcome to OnBrand! In this episode, host Sarah Grace McCandless explores what it means to create communities around brands through meaningful customer engagement with Carrie Melissa Jones, a community strategist and co-author of the book Building Brand Communities: How Organizations Succeed by Creating Belonging.

Creating vibrant brand communities starts with engagement, but it’s not just about attracting eyeballs or meeting your marketing metrics — that’s “empty engagement” according to Carrie. To her, the key is making your engagement meaningful.

Carrie explains many of the ways that companies fall flat in their efforts to build community due to shallow gestures or empty promises. “So, what is meaningful engagement?” Carrie ponders briefly before answering. “Any way that we can bring people together to (1), knit relationships between members, and then (2), connect more deeply to the purpose of the entire organization or the entire community,” she says. “So, if it doesn’t serve one of those two purposes — people, or purpose — then what we’re doing is most likely creating this empty engagement, which, again, steals people’s attention but doesn’t necessarily add value to their lives.”

In addition to studying consumers and the complex online communities they create, Carrie founded the Gather Community Consulting firm and formerly served as a founding partner and chief operating officer for CMX Media. A graduate of UCLA, Carrie was named one of the three experts to follow in community management in 2016 by Salesforce.","0","00:33:43",People & Blogs,{},NA,youtube,NA,Fostering meaningful connections_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unTL7eytE_c,Depersonalization

Did you know that 87 percent of millennials rate professional growth and development as important to them in their jobs? By contrast, only 69 percent of non- millennials say that’s important to them.

Millennials are on to something we all might do well to consider. Skills and knowledge are imperative for anyone who desires to advance in their career– either by earning a promotion or landing a new job and to develop so we can contribute at the highest level.

But consistently learning and developing in your career can seem difficult at times, especially if your company doesn’t offer much formal professional development training.

Research has shown that even as millennials list career development as important to them, companies are offering less development training.

And Vanderbilt University shows that when business leaders rated themselves on 67 different managerial skills, “developing others” was often ranked last on their lists. 

So let’s face it… it’s on each of us to take charge of our own development. How can we do that? Here are five tips to take charge today!

 - Take an online course. LinkedIn has an online education company called Lynda. And if the course you want to take will help you do your job better, you might be able to complete it during the workday.

- Inc magazine suggests joining social networking groups with other professionals in your field. With how much time we all spend on social media these days, why not use that time to learn something new? Go on Facebook or LinkedIn to find a social networking group that relates to your career. That allows you to learn what challenges others in your field are resolving, and to hear about the latest trends in your industry.

- If there is an important emerging trend, take it upon yourself to become an expert. Do research, read the latest news and literature, see if there are any conferences you might attend.

- Seek mentoring. This doesn’t mean waiting to be considered for a formal mentoring program.

Simply seek advice from people who are farther along in their careers than you are.
Taking charge of your development and learning will give you the confidence to succeed. You’ll know what you want to accomplish, you’ll be able to make realistic plans for reaching goals.  Great benefits no matter what generation we belong to.

Fatigue is a feeling of tiredness.[1] It may be sudden or gradual in onset. It is a normal phenomenon if it follows prolonged physical or mental activity, and resolves completely with rest. However, it may be a symptom of a medical condition if it is prolonged, severe, progressive, or occurs without provocation.

Physical fatigue is the transient inability of muscles to maintain optimal physical performance, and is made more severe by intense physical exercise.[2][3][4] Mental fatigue is a transient decrease in maximal cognitive performance resulting from prolonged periods of cognitive activity. Mental fatigue can manifest as somnolence, lethargy, or directed attention fatigue.[5]


Fatigue and 'feelings of fatigue' are sometimes confused.[6] Unlike weakness, fatigue can usually be alleviated by periods of rest. 
Physical fatigue, or muscle fatigue, is the temporary physical inability of muscles to perform optimally. The onset of muscle fatigue during physical activity is gradual, and depends upon an individual's level of physical fitness – other factors include sleep deprivation and overall health. Fatigue can be reversed by rest.[7] Physical fatigue can be caused by a lack of energy in the muscle, by a decrease of the efficiency of the neuromuscular junction or by a reduction of the drive originating from the central nervous system.[8] The central component of fatigue is triggered by an increase of the level of serotonin in the central nervous system.[9] During motor activity, serotonin released in synapses that contact motoneurons promotes muscle contraction.[10] During high level of motor activity, the amount of serotonin released increases and a spillover occurs. Serotonin binds to extrasynaptic receptors located on the axon initial segment of motoneurons with the result that nerve impulse initiation and thereby muscle contraction are inhibited.[11]

Muscle strength testing can be used to determine the presence of a neuromuscular disease, but cannot determine its cause. Additional testing, such as electromyography, can provide diagnostic information, but information gained from muscle strength testing alone is not enough to diagnose most neuromuscular disorders.[12]

People with multiple sclerosis experience a form of overwhelming lassitude or tiredness that can occur at any time of the day, for any duration, and that does not necessarily recur in a recognizable pattern for any given patient, referred to as ""neurological fatigue"".[13][14]","0","00:04:57",People & Blogs,"{fatigue,""fatigue symptoms"",""fatigue meaning"",""fatigue after covid 19 recovery"",""fatigue jeff prosper"",""fatigue test"",""fatigue failure"",""fatigue meditation"",""fatigue after covid vaccine"",""fatigue pronunciation"",""fatigue fatigue"",""fatigue after workout"",""fatigue treatment""}",NA,youtube,NA,Overcoming mental fatigue_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTNn6hPz9vo,Emotional exhaustion

ALWAYS ASK FOR JOB DETAILS. Before Taking on a Role. Ask if you can be introduced when you arrive for an interview. if no one has already offered to introduce you. Observe carefully. to the physiology of the workers' faces. both their verbal and nonverbal communication patterns. You start to question right away if the company is toxic. Unless you desperately need money, trust your gut and stay away. responsibilities that have a lot of negative energy. Be mindful of the lighting and noise level. the setup of the table and the amount of clutter. Do you?, ask yourself. both physically and emotionally at ease performing their jobs in such a setting. an impressive wage. may be alluring, but your wellbeing and sanity must come first. Trust your instincts, even if others tell you the job is a great opportunity you shouldn't miss. You have the ability to influence positive change. workplace, but if it's outside your comfort zone, you don't have to sacrifice your mental and physical health. Never feel guilty about selecting the ideal career path. 

PUT YOUR GIFT TO WORK AS A SALES FACE. Since empaths are not naturally displayed, the thought of having to sell yourself during a job interview may be enough to turn one into one. make you anxious. However, consider yourself an empath. In the workplace, qualities are becoming a more valuable asset. We frequently equate the business world and even the public sector with a horror mentality in which everyone is constantly competing for the best and trying to outdo one another. employment and the most money. Our society, though, is becoming more conscious of the importance of caring. There is only one path forward: to each other and to our planet. Although there is still a long way to go before the world is more compassionate, we are gradually coming to appreciate the advantages of collaboration and a healthy work-life balance. about dog food. a canine mentality. When you possess a. challenge is an option. with your gift! You understand that life and work are much more than. either a job or a pay check. Roles fit your gift perfectly. that call for coaching, conflict resolution, and listening skills. Dr. Judith Orloff is a psychiatrist, writer, and empath. empaths bring enthusiasm, excellent communication skills, and leadership abilities to their work. As soon as the interviewer.

 If the hiring manager asks what you can bring to the position, don't be hesitant to provide examples of times when you've shown those abilities. Even if you have strong leadership potential, working a job that requires constant interaction with coworkers and clients may be too demanding, especially if you are still developing your confidence in your capacity to handle toxic individuals and negative energies. When submitting a job application, be truthful with yourself. Consider your options carefully before applying if you would be working in a busy team with little time for rest during the day. Empaths are typically best suited for independent work or positions in small businesses. We all have different needs and abilities, so don't let anyone make you feel inferior because you can't do that in a ""normal"" workplace. Working in a big office or noisy environment can be overstimulating - and that's a good thing! As an empath, you might need to speak with coworkers, management, and clients quickly. On the other hand, if done to a great extent, working alone can result in social isolation. For instance, if you choose to run a small business from home, keep in mind to set aside time for your loved ones at least a few times per week. You should not only take care of your relationships, but it's also beneficial occasionally to get an outside opinion on your work.

A hugely pervasive syndrome that not only affects people like professional caregivers but also most of us one way or another. Juliette herself has suffered from Compassion Fatigue first hand and she is very passionate about sharing the insidious nature of this syndrome and the devastating effects it can have on your life. Compassion Fatigue can potentially happen to any age group. From people in their twenties right up to their senior years. It is an important, critical topic that Juliette has pulled out of the shadows so that we can recognize the symptoms and develop a renewed resilience to teach ourselves how to continue to give compassion without sacrificing ourselves and our lives. Born and raised in London, England, Juliette was a stunt horse rider for MGM pictures then later a London Playboy Bunny. From 18 she spent the next 20 years performing a one woman show in cabarets world-wide.  In 1971 she moved to Beirut, Lebanon where she lived for 4 years during their vicious civil war.  
Moving to NYC in her forties, she thrived as a soap opera scriptwriter, winning two Writers Guild Awards and a nomination for a Daytime Emmy.  She then become an ATP pilot and Master Flight Instructor which led her to working for 10 years at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Utah, eventually flying rescue missions in New Orleans saving abused and abandoned dogs in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Over 6000 animals were saved.
Currently she is on a passionate mission to help and guide people who have lost themselves in who they've been for everyone else.

I describe how dopamine, a chemical we all make in our brain, underlies our desire for and pursuit of our goals, as well as our capacity to move and experience pleasure. I describe how we can leverage specific behaviors, reward schedules and dopamine-prolactin balance to help ensure we can maintain motivation and capacity for pleasure over the long term. I also discuss dopamine in the context of ADHD, craving and addiction, and some absolutely amazing results about specificity of drug effects based purely on belief.

Maintaining balance in our personal and professional lives is a key priority for overall well-being.  It is especially important in terms of managing stress and avoiding burnout.

By championing work-life balance, greater flexibility and a genuine understanding of the pressures associated with juggling family and career priorities, your organization's reputation will be enhanced, a happier workplace will ensue and your team will have greater opportunity to thrive and enjoy a richer live experience .

It is time that we extend the same empathy and aid to mental health as we do to physical health. One of the best ways to end the stigma surrounding mental health is by spreading the idea that it is always ok to take a break for your mental wellbeing, especially for teens and students. Hailey Hardcastle is a freshman at the University of Oregon and a student mental health advocate. This year she was named one of Teen Vogues 21 under 21 most influential young people for her work on passing House Bill 2191, which allows students to take mental health days off from school. Hardcastle works with other teens nationwide to promote student advocacy and come up with creative solutions to teenage mental challenges.

Hence, here is one simple yet profound activity for goal setting and achieving motivation for employees that can be done after lunch during office hours as team gets little lazy and things slow down the way India has slowed down in economy currently. It feels as if there is recession and everyone is on cost cutting. 

During such times, when team is inspired to activate their mind with some challenge then the chances of productivity increases. Inspiration to set a goal is a very important aspect of life and then activate oneself rather than challenging oneself to achieve the set goal, is the next step. 

In this video you will see that a regular pen was given to everyone in Team Yaha and they were asked to catch it with one hand and that too in falling direction from the top. 

Everyone felt that is really easy and simple but when they were unable to catch a simple pen falling from 3 feet height, they were alert and their neurons activated. 

Each one tried various things and finally they learnt something amazing. If there is a goal and if one is committed to the goal then realising goal becomes part of ones nature. 

#Teamwork and teamspirit are byproducts of such fun challenges. Do this activity of goal setting and achieving motivation for employees and see how your team responds to it.

Históricamente, el campo de la ciencia no ha sido un lugar donde se valoraran mucho las voces y perspectivas diversas. Estamos familiarizados con los nombres y logros de científicos famosos como Thomas Edison o Albert Einstein. Sin embargo, ¿hemos oído hablar de los logros del famoso científico negro Emmett Chappelle, quien hizo descubrimientos en bioluminiscencia y descubrió una manera de extraer y usar la luz de las luciérnagas? ¡Qué genial! Apuesto a que la mayoría de nosotros probablemente tampoco haya oído hablar de Marie M. Daly: fue la primera mujer afroamericana en obtener su doctorado y realizó grandes contribuciones al campo de la nutrición. Esos son solo dos ejemplos de científicos negros pioneros que la historia olvidó.

Como científicos jóvenes, nuestro objetivo es ayudar a que el campo de la ciencia sea más inclusivo para todos. Cuando personas de diversos orígenes que tienen diferentes perspectivas trabajan juntas para lograr un objetivo compartido, pueden hacer mucho más porque comenzarán con una gama más amplia de información, ideas y experiencias. Podemos lograr esto si nos tomamos el tiempo para reconocer y apreciar los logros de los grandes científicos que nos precedieron. Si no hemos oído hablar de los descubrimientos de Marie Daly o Emmett Chappelle, entonces, ¿cuántas otras contribuciones científicas increíbles hay olvidados o no reconocidos?

Su trabajo hoy es encontrar un científico negro importante del que no haya oído hablar antes e investigar qué contribuyeron y por qué fueron importantes. Puede iniciar su búsqueda en google o biography.com o utilizar este recurso a continuación.

https://www.osc.org/black-innovators-in-stem-who-changed-the-world/

A medida que nos esforzamos por hacer del campo de la ciencia un espacio más seguro e inclusivo, sabemos que debemos honrar el pasado y celebrar los logros futuros por venir. Lo más importante es que siempre debemos creer en el poder de nuestro propio potencial: USTED puede marcar la diferencia.

In moments of great change (transitions) we find ourselves using our personal and collective emotional capacity to adapt to the new conditions we are facing. This pandemic is both an unprecedented experience in our lives and it is occurring at a global scale, which means that we are both dealing with this alongside everyone else and that there is a lot of uncertainty about how to move forward.

In these days, we are challenged by our lives shifting from being outside to being at home. This means adapting and changing the ways we relate with our work and with our families. The boundaries we had before may no longer exist (work isn’t just at work and home isn’t just at home).

In our work, we are spending more time on the phone and on the computer, giving way to more instances of miscommunication and less time to fortify our bonds with our colleagues. In our friendships, we are being creative with ways to spend time with each other, but it often doesn’t compare to being able to spend time outside with each other. The hugs, words, and interactions we used to rely on are no longer the ones we can continue to lean on.

It is safe to say that we need to increase our emotional capacity and resiliency so that we can be better aware of what is going on for us and the people around us. We need to lean into the traditions we are already a part of, learn new practices, and explore what is supportive to us collectively so that we can strengthen our capacity to go through this transition together.

We will review important information about what goes on during transitions; go over concepts in psychology and neuroscience such as emotions, needs, values, trauma, and resiliency; and we will share some resources and practices that can support in increasing our collective emotional capacity.

Ed will describe two common forms of motivation; autonomous and controlled. He discusses the different results of each form and the implications for aspects of our lives; especially work and relationships.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

Rules for Achieving Your Goals: Tips for Setting and Attaining Your Objectives""

Rule 1: Goals should be both broad and specific. Combining broad, healthy goals with specific targets helps guide your progress and protect against unintended consequences.
Rule 2: Goals should follow the SMART formula: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. This ensures that your goals are clear, attainable, and have a defined timeline.
Rule 3: Break down your goals into smaller, actionable tasks. This makes them more manageable and easier to achieve.
Rule 4: Regularly review and adjust your goals as needed. This helps ensure that you are on track to achieve them and can make necessary changes to reach your desired outcomes.
Rule 5: Maintain a healthy balance in achieving your goals. Don't sacrifice your well-being or relationships in pursuit of success.
Rule 6: Overcome common obstacles to achieving your goals, such as the sunk cost fallacy.

With society becoming more fast-paced and productive, people are starting to normalize the habit of overworking. Because of this, people tend to confuse “mental exhaustion” with “laziness” since they both look similar on the surface level. This video might help you remember why it's important to take a break without feeling guilty.

--

Socrates, one of the founding fathers of Western philosophical thought, was on trial. Many believed he was an enemy of the state, accusing the philosopher of corrupting the youth and refusing to recognize their gods. But Socrates wasn’t feared for claiming to have all the answers, but rather, for asking too many questions. Erick Wilberding digs into the technique known as the Socratic Method.

How do we navigate our differences at work, at home, in politics and in society? In this enlightening, lightly humorous, and research-based talk, Dr. Jamil Zaki delivers an astonishing overview of empathy: how it really works, why it truly matters (especially to work places), why it’s on the decline, and how to build it back up through deliberate practice. For anyone who works in HR, who leads teams, or is part of one, Zaki will redefine how you understand, empathize, and work with others—an issue companies have been debating forever. Zooming out, Zaki’s insights will help you revitalize your connection to your neighborhood, your community, the world at large.

When I did my previous video on stress, I got an overwhelming response that for most of you the workplace is your major source of stress. Now, it's normal to have stress in the workplace to a certain degree. You are going to have deadlines you have to meet at work. You are going to have expectations. But when this workplace stress becomes too great, it can actually decrease your productivity. It can decrease your success. And in addition to harming your physical health, workplace stress can roll over into your personal life, your home life, and it can affect your relationships.

So, what can you do? In my last video, I recommended that one way to reduce stress was to remove the stressor. However, for most of us, we need to work to eat, so we can't just leave our jobs most of the time. So, what can we do? If you can't leave your job, yet you can't afford to let stress harm your health, then you need to find ways to reduce this job-related stress. 
Numerous studies have shown that for the majority of American adults, they identify the workplace as the number one source of stress. How do you know if you are being affected by workplace stress? Well, you may experience anxiety and depression while at work, or even when you think about work. You may also have difficulty sleeping, insomnia. You may have a constant fear of losing your job or a fear of not meeting your job's demands. And you may even have some of the physical signs and symptoms, such as fatigue, headache, hypertension, chest pain. And you may even be more prone to infections.

Did you know that most of us spend 13 hours a day sitting down?

All of this inactivity has the potential to cause serious health problems. But, it can be hard to stay fit and healthy when you have a sedentary job. 

So, here are six tips for boosting your health and well-being at work…

1.Build activity into your commute. Why not walk, cycle or jog part of the way to work? Or, if you take public transport, get off one stop early and walk the rest of the way. 

2. Take regular screen breaks. Aim to get away from your desk for a few minutes every hour. Chat to a colleague rather than emailing them, take a phone call while standing, or take a look out of the window.

3. Use the stairs. Forget the elevator and take the stairs. Doing this will help to build up your aerobic capacity, raise your heart rate, and increase your muscle strength.

4. Hold stand-up or walking meetings. Not only will this get you up, it will make your meetings fun, creative and productive.

5. Go outside for lunch. Make an effort to leave your desk for lunch, even if it’s just for a short walk around the block. This will boost blood circulation, flex your joints, and give you time for mental recharging and reflection.

6. Eat well! To be truly effective, healthy behavior has to combine exercise and diet. So, prepare something that’s both nutritious and delicious!","0","00:02:05",Education,"{health,well-being,wellbeing,""dangers of sitting"",""health at work"",""screen breaks"",stress,workplace,""stand-up meetings"",""walking meetings"",fitness}",NA,youtube,NA,Enhancing well-being at work_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGlACnI7iXc,Emotional exhaustion

How to recover from mental fatigue
How To Recover From Mental Fatigue Fast
Mental Fatigue, End it (Today)
Are you fatigued? Does your brain seek to take a long vacation far from where you are right now? You may be feeling mentally worn out.
These days, it's all too common to feel mentally exhausted. Our minds are feeling beyond worn out due to uncertainty, high levels of stress, and a demanding lifestyle. On the other hand, enduring endless mental Fatigue can have negative effects on our personal and professional well-being.
Let's examine how mental Fatigue affects us, its signs, and possible treatments.
What is mental Fatigue?
Similar to how a person can become physically exhausted after engaging in strenuous exercise, mental exhaustion and stress can also lead to mental exhaustion. This happens when you're consistently overloaded and don't have enough time for adequate rest and recovery, which causes cognitive fatigue. It might be challenging for you to concentrate on one task at a time, solve problems, or make executive decisions
Here are 10 tips to reduce mental fatigue
#1. Make a self-care plan.
Create a self-care plan that is suited to your needs and concentrate on your well-being. Choose a few routines that truly make you happy. These can be practices like meditation, deep breathing, being outside, or anything else that enhances your physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

#2. Perform a routine exercise
One of the best methods to lessen the effects of mental Fatigue is regular exercise. A recent study found that regardless of your age or gender, more physical activity makes you feel less tired.
You get a boost of energy, feel better about yourself, and get a better sleep when you exercise, whether it's outside or virtually. Exercises that improve cardiovascular health and build muscle also aid in the treatment of fibromyalgia and the prevention of other illnesses.
#3. Consume a balanced diet.
Your mental well-being is directly impacted by what you put into your body. Serotonin levels are raised by consuming adequate amounts of water and gut-healthy foods. Your immune system, resilience, and mental energy all benefit from high levels of serotonin.

#4. Correct circadian rhythm issues
One typical cause or symptom of brain fog is sleep deficiency. Reset your sleep clock and work on your sleep hygiene if you're not getting enough sleep.
Getting more restful sleep reduces anxiety and stress, which lessens the signs of mental Fatigue. You can seek out a mental health professional for medical guidance or treatment if you're experiencing insomnia.
#5. Let Go of Perfectionism
You may struggle with perfectionism if you often take on too many tasks. Unfortunately, this habit just serves to extend fatigue and a weakened sense of self-worth. Instead, make an effort to just concentrate on being good enough and try your best to accept the rest.
#6. Stay Connected
When under stress, a lot of people cut off contact with their loved ones, but this can be harmful. Call a friend or arrange to meet up with them the next time you're feeling stressed. These connections have the power to heal deeply.
#7. Limit Distractions When Working
Place your phone in another room or silence. Decide limits on how often you'll play games or check on social media. To let coworkers know when you are working and unavailable, you might want to consider posting a sign on your door.
#8. Take Regular Breaks Throughout the Day
While ""powering through"" can seem like the best tactic, research proves that most people perform better when breaks are scheduled into their schedule. We all require some downtime. Try the Pomodoro technique, where you set a timer for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. Take a longer 20–30 minute break following four intervals.
#9. Prioritize Important Tasks When Your Energy Is Highest
Most likely, you are aware of when you are ""at your best."" Therefore, if you are a morning person, try to schedule meetings and critical tasks first thing. If you're more productive in the afternoon or evening, take care of the simpler issues first. Your mental energy will rise as a result of this.
#10. Avoid or Limit Time Suckers
Be mindful of these passive activities even though it may be tempting to browse social media or watch another episode of your favorite show. Participating in meaningful hobbies that stretch your brain in new ways and foster passion may prove to be much more refreshing.

Work-related stress may affect us all. Emails, Slack messages, phones ringing off the hook, a coworker stopping by for an impromptu meeting — it's enough to exhaust anyone.

Tension is normal, especially if you have an approaching deadline or a difficult job. When job stress becomes chronic, it can have a negative impact on both your physical and mental well-being.

Stress isn’t always a bad thing; it can be handy for a burst of extra energy and focus, like when you’re playing a competitive sport or have to speak in public. But when it’s continuous, it actually begins to change your brain. Madhumita Murgia shows how chronic stress can affect brain size, its structure, and how it functions, right down to the level of your genes.

We have all felt the impact of Covid-19. It has had a damaging effect on us physically and mentally, on our sense of ourselves, our ability to cope, on our relationships, our communities, on the economy and global partnership. However, some groups of people have felt the impact much more than others because they were already vulnerable, or they now find themselves, particularly at risk. In this series, we explore some ways in which psychological practitioners have worked with local community groups or people at particular risk, to harness strengths and empower them to manage their emotional and practical challenges.

This series explores the broad range of ways, voluntary groups, charities, local communities and statutory services use psychological practitioners to build individual and community resilience.","0","00:29:56",Film & Animation,{},NA,youtube,NA,Building emotional resilience_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZZgJ0m6TyU,Emotional exhaustion

Empathy is the missing link to innovation and children can help us find it.

Jackie Acho speaks and writes about innovation on her blog, The Currency of Empathy®. After 20 years in innovation and leadership consulting, Acho believes that the value of empathy and vulnerability is missing from organizations as a management tool. Acho is president of the Acho Group, a former partner of McKinsey & Company and holds a master’s degree and Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)","0","00:18:07",Nonprofits & Activism,"{""Career/Life Development"",Life,Culture,ted,""tedx talks"",""ted x"",""ted talks"",""tedx talk"",tedx,""United States"",Lifestyle,English,TEDxTalks,""ted talk""}",NA,youtube,NA,Developing empathy at work_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6dyrmHIjao,Depersonalization

About Me:
I’m Emma McAdam. I’m a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, and I have worked in various settings of change and growth since 2004. My experience includes juvenile corrections, adventure therapy programs, wilderness therapy programs, an eating disorder treatment center, a residential treatment center, and I currently work in an outpatient therapy clinic.  

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction. 
And deeper than all of that, the Gospel of Jesus Christ orients my personal worldview and sense of security, peace, hope, and love https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe

Mike shares three things that will help you build healthy relationships. If a couple wants to get married, that’s something we should celebrate. However, that doesn’t mean we should blindly encourage them no matter what, and offer cliche advice like, “You’re in love, and that’s all that matters,” or “Do what you heart tells you.” No matter how convincing a couple’s love for each other seems, there are some things that always need to be considered, especially in young relationships between two people who want to rush into marriage.  When it comes to relationships, there are three things Fr. Mike says to keep in mind:

There are some things only time can reveal
Let your relationship be the actual age it is
Learn how to make decisions together

I explain the three major chemical systems that are altered in depression: norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. I discuss genetic predispositions to depression and how stress, thyroid hormone and cortisol play a role in many forms of depression. I also discuss inflammation as a common feature of many depression symptoms. I review 8 specific science-supported protocols for treating and avoiding depression, including EPA fatty acids (which have been shown to rival certain prescription treatments), how exercise protects against depression, studies of creatine, adjusting dopamine balance and more. I also discuss the results of ongoing clinical trials for ketamine and psilocybin for depression, how these compounds work and finally, I review how ketogenic diets can help in certain cases of depression, especially treatment-resistant major depression.

Two women committed to bouncing forward no matter what life throws at them.
Two women who believe that self-leadership and taking charge of one's life is the key to success regardless of circumstances.
Two women who understand that no-one is coming to rescue you.
Two women who are keenly watching as the Human Resources Playbook is being rewritten at this time.
Two women who run their own speaking and consulting businesses.
Two women who coach senior leaders and their teams to get the people piece right.

This gritty interview will challenge the way you think about yourself in the workplace. Joni Peddie, resilience expert (bouncing forward is her catchphrase), was interviewing me. It turned into a robust conversation that will add so much value to you today in terms of being proactive about your own career trajectory and the game of life.Human Potential and Parenting Expert, Nikki Bush empowers individuals, families and teams in business and education to win at work, home and life.

In a curious way, Kellogg's music represents a meeting point between these two styles, with songs that delve deep into the personal, but make room for a sense of fun, while the music, which is intelligent and intimate, is also full of passion and electricity. With his long-time band The Sixers on hiatus, Stephen is currently working on a solo album to be released in 2013.

Here's the talk's abstract: 

After the events of the last year, burnout has been on everyone’s minds. Are you feeling nostalgia for the days when your job wasn’t such a hassle? Do you find yourself struggling to care about your job… or anything at all? You may be wrestling with burnout.. But what exactly IS burnout? If you’re dealing with it, what do you do about it, or how do you talk to someone else about it?

Come and get a glimpse beneath the surface of this phenomenon in this talk pulling from both personal experiences and psychological studies. You’ll learn the basics of burnout... and also what sorts of situations lead to it, how it can intertwine with other mental challenges including trauma, and why fixing it isn’t just as simple as taking time off work. Most importantly, you’ll learn things you can start doing tomorrow to bounce back from burnout, and how you can even help prevent it for yourself and others.","0","00:56:24",Howto & Style,"{burnout,psychology}",NA,youtube,NA,Job satisfaction and burnout_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XYK8ulQId0,Depersonalization

Job satisfaction tips,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdxtdYnSvWE,Employee motivation and job satisfaction,Stephen Goldberg,unknown,"10327","54",0,"2","We all want employees to be motivated in their jobs and if we’re the employee we want to enjoy our work.

The employer’s responsibility is to make sure that the work being performed by the employee is for the most part the type of tasks that interest them. The employer also needs to provide the proper working conditions, support, compensation and rewards that meet the needs of the employee.

On the employee’s side it is the responsibility of each person to find work that interest them and choose a company that will provide the type of conditions that are motivating. You must understand yourself and know how your personal interests translate into jobs in the workplace.

Just because somebody has a skill for something doesn’t necessarily mean that they are passionate about the work. If you want to get the best out of people you need to align what they’re good at with what they most enjoy doing.

For example a classic error made by many companies is to promote the best employee to be a manager or supervisor. Take an employee who sells complex computer hardware solutions to large companies and whose interests are mainly associated with selling, technology and creativity. This person might excel at their job of helping clients solve complex problems, but put that person into a management role and he or she might fail. The management role in this case would require someone with high interests in people, as one of the main tasks of a manager is to develop others so that the department can perform and grow. Without the people interest the new manager might continue to override his salespeople because his skills and interests lie more in problem-solving in creative ways that produce a sales result rather than and coaching and training the salespeople to perform at a higher level.

Self-understanding

To better understand ones key interests requires some self-reflection or an assessment tool. When hiring people an assessment tool can be extremely useful to get a quick and valid understanding of what someone’s interests are.

I use the Profile XT (http://www.profilesinternational.com/employee-assessment-products-overview/profilext-personality-assessment-test/) and the Profile Sales Assessment (http://www.profilesinternational.com/employee-assessment-products-overview/profiles-sales-assessment/) to provide greater understanding of people. These tools cover six interest areas; enterprising, people, technical, financial/ administrative, creative and mechanical. The assessment tool determines the top three interest areas of the person and compares that to the requirements of the position.

Take Stock of your Interests

Another approach to understanding your interests is to write down the things you do that interests you the most and the things that you dislike the most at work or at home. For example I enjoy anything that allows me to be creative both when it comes to business as well as artful pursuits. I also enjoy business and have turned hobbies into businesses. I know I dislike administrative work as I tend to procrastinate and avoid those tasks. I particularly like to help others solve problems that will help them be more successful. Thus it makes sense for me to be a coach and trainer helping people solve business problems in creative ways.

Although it is extremely important that we have the right skills for the job if we really enjoy and are passionate about the work, we will be much more fulfilled and successful. This will translate into better performance and rewards for ourselves and our company.

Working with GenZs is not easy. 
And the frustration, the struggle, and the memes of older generations trying to manage them is the only beginning.
All of this comes from just the handful of GenZs old enough to work today, but they are 30% of the population and will become 30% of the workforce in a couple of years. 
But us Millenials trying to manage them, we often forget how much GenXs and Boomers hated us. 
We were entitled and lazy. We quit easily. Right? 

So why does each generation struggle so much to deal with the next one? How true is it that millennials work less and that GenZs are even worse? 

It’s the topic of countless articles, papers, and rants- but the truth about how each generation has been forced to adapt and navigate the reality of eventually replacing the older ones. It’s not a simple nut to crack- but let’s give it a shot.

I am a Licensed Psychologist, Coach, and Speaker who specializes in working with lawyers, medical doctors, and other professionals in high-pressure careers.

When I was a child, I heard the grownups around me say, ""I hate going to work."" I began observing their resentment, anger, and frustration and wondered - is that what’s in store for me? I became determined that it wouldn’t be. This drove me to strategically design my life in a balanced way. My biggest passion as a coach is to help my clients recover from burnout by helping them do the same. This ensures they can feel energized both at work and at home.  

My doctorate in Psychology is from Fordham University. I combine my background in Psychology, my nearly two decades of experience in the field, and evidence-based tools to bring you a multicultural approach that grounds, establish a solid foundation on which to build additional strengths, and integrates mind, body, and spirit.
I am an enthusiast in life. I bring that passion to my work to draw out my clients' true potential. I believe that sometimes we need guidance to attain clarity and always we want to be heard and seen in a compassionate and caring way. 

I take pride in providing transformational results in a short time-frame by honing in on your blindspots to increase self-awareness, by ensuring your goals are aligned with your values, and by giving you the tools you need to be self-sufficient. 

I offer a complimentary session to give you a sense of how I work and how my approach can address your challenges. I call it the ""Barefoot"" session because coaching with me is about grounding and this session starts that process to help you feel connected to yourself. Schedule your Barefoot Session today.

Communication in relationships is very important. In this dating and relationships advice video, I share with you 7 keys to effective communication. To have a healthy and successful relationship, you need to embrace all the 7 keys to effective communication that I discuss in this relationship advice video.

Many relationships fail because of communication issues and this video will give you 7 keys to effective communication in your relationship to make your relationship better. People fail to sit down talk about their communication issues and express themselves properly. We need to learn how to talk to each other and how to listen actively and properly and these communication tips will help you improve your communication skills.

In this video, I give you relationship advice that will assist you in establishing effective communication for improving your communication skills in your relationship so that you can make your relationship better. 

One of the biggest problems is that when people try to talk to each other, the person listening is simply waiting for their chance to counter your argument. They are waiting for their chance to hit you back or to defend themselves or dismiss what you are saying and that is not going to produce healthy communication.

When someone is speaking, the goal should be to try to understand them and if you do not understand them, you go to asking for more clarity, you go to asking more questions to try to dig deeper so that you can have a clearer understanding of how they are feeling and what they are trying to communicate. 

As a certified life coach, dating coach, and relationship coach who provides relationship and dating advice for women and men, I want to make dating and relationships easier for you, and I pray that you may find this video helpful. 

If you are asking these questions or searching for these issues:

- Is communication in relationships important 
- Why is communication important in relationships
- How to have effective communication in relationships
- What is effective communication
- How do I improve my communication skills
- What are the keys to effective communication
- How do I fix communication issues in a relationship
- Effective communication skills
- How to improve your communications skills
- How to communicate effectively
- How to fix communication in a relationship

Well, I believe this dating and relationship advice video will give you the clarity you need.

This Reiki session is intended to remove all the energy blockages that are hindering you from achieving your goals.


Being in a sleep, awake, occupied or engaged in other activities while simultaneously  receiving Reiki, will never impair from its effectiveness. 
Reiki always works for your highest good and most benevolent outcomes.

The infinite wisdom of Reiki flows only where it is desired, affecting matter at subtle levels. Your personal acceptance and openness to receiving this healing energy will dictate the level of energy to receive.

You are encouraged to play this distance healing recording repeatedly as often as you wish. This Reiki sessions can have cumulative effects, meaning, the healing energy infused in these videos is amplified each time you play it.

Each of us has our unique response to the healing energy and our experience can indeed vary from session to session. It depends on how sensitive someone is to energy. Just relax and enjoy this healing energy flowing to you.

This is a ""real time"" Reiki session recorded from the beginning to end.  While channeling energy my focused and devoted attention will prevail throughout the session. Therefore, I do not speak and remain silent at all times. Soothing background music is used to further promote deeper relaxation during the session. 

In order for Reiki to work effectively, please be open to receiving the healing energy.
It is extremely beneficial to drink water after receiving Reiki as part of the healing process. 


Important Note: Treatment with Energy Healing such as Reiki - does not promise to cure any illness or condition nor replaces professional medical treatment.

Hi everyone,
Do you want to know if a friend, colleague, spouse, partner, or family member you're dealing with lacks empathy? There are some warning signs to be aware of.

A lack of empathy is the inability to empathize with or show genuine concern for the feelings of others. People with this trait are pretty difficult to deal with, and the signs can be seen in their behavior patterns.
However, if you're unfamiliar with these signs, here are some of those that you can notice.

Located on the Square, the Dane County Farmers’ Market is also one of the largest producer-only farmers’ markets in the U.S. located right at the state capitol. Farmers’ markets are a bridge between rural and urban areas, cultivating loyal and local following for farmers and producers, and increasing investments in the local economy. 

Farmers’ markets are the best place to get fresh and organic vegetables and fruits on a weekly basis; where both an average Joe and an award-winning chef can connect with the farmers who grow through sustainable practices, keeping the land healthier for future generations.

Free Quiz: Are You A Quality Partner?
https://form.happilycommitted.com/sf/01dee9c7

My name is Coach Adrian and you may know me from all of the videos on LoveAdviceTV. This project is called the Happily Committed project where we are helping both individuals and couples maximize the love they already have. Our mission is to help couples stay together. 

This is a message of self-empowerment, happiness, and detachment.

01:08 - The Push and Pull relationship is a real phenomenon. There is a direct correlation between intense feelings of love and control. The more out of control you feel in love the more likely it is that you are experiencing those ""in love"" intense feelings. 
01:42 - After a breakup, your feelings are so overwhelming because you have no control
02:25 - The importance of practicing detachment in a relationship
03:20 - Letting someone you love go even it's just temporary allows you to give yourself time to value and love yourself, and giving your partner an opportunity to miss you
04:15 - Fighting for a relationship alone can make you look weak. No one wants to be with someone who is desperate. 
04:50 - Your goal should be to position yourself in a way where your partner has to chase you instead of vice versa. 
05:15 - Give your partner the space to value you. Ultimately this is about you taking control of your love life. Sometimes taking control means taking a step back. It means letting go.

Strained from working day after day under extreme stress, many are leaving the profession entirely. This, in turn, deepens the workforce shortage.

Our own Sheetal Shah, Sr. VP, Commercial, talked to clinician advocate Janae Sharp, founder of Sharp Index, and Stanford University surgeon Dr. Kristan Staudenmayer to hear their insights on how healthcare executives can create the environment for real change.

Mental exhaustion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1BmhnH-G4Q,How to Overcome Mental Exhaustion,Sarah Claire Ryan,unknown,"1951","74",0,"9","All of us can get a bit exhausted from time to time, especially if we have something big on, like a project at work or caring for a poorly loved one. But if you’re feeling exhausted for no clear reason and are tired all of the time, it is time to stop and review.

If you have been in a state of chronic stress, burnout or mental exhaustion, then you may find it hard to recognise the signs. Some typical things to watch out for are being tired ALL the time, procrastination, lack of motivation, escapism (through Netflix or social media), reliance on bad habits like drinking wine and eating junk, detaching (accompanied by a feeling of “I just can’t be bothered) and being overly triggered by things outside of your control.

If you have recognised that you are struggling, here are my five tips for how to overcome mental exhaustion:

1. Connect

This could be the most important skill to develop to recover from mental exhaustion. The ability to accept help from others - to lean on them for support - is invaluable. 

Whether you need someone to help you retreat for an evening in their spare room, do a food shop for you or babysit your children so that you can rest, getting support is crucial.

2. Sleep

This step is obvious if you are exhausted - but let’s be honest, you don’t always do it do you? When we are completely knackered, we just can’t see it - we underestimate the impact of sleep. Time to turn off the TV, get the phone on airplane mode and go straight up to bed. Like at 8pm or even earlier! 

3. Rehydrate

Again, when we’re busy and tired, we neglect this. Rehydrate quickly by created a jug of water with a splash of juice and a pinch of salt. 
This step is important because it can dramatically help your executive function – and when you’re thinking more clearly you will really improve the care you give yourself.

4. Nourish

It is time to focus on getting the right nutrients inside of you and eat a proper meal, with vegetables! As I say that, I am reminding myself to remember this tip as it is one I often forget!

5. Body Work

Finally, do something to replenish your physical body. A bath, a full body massage, a sauna… something to take care of your body will make an enormous difference to your exhaustion.

When we fail to understand our thoughts and feelings natural change we wind up feeling stuck. The nature of the human experience is that thoughts and feelings naturally change. When we deeply understand this, we become less attached to any particular thought and feeling. This frees us up for a new experience of any given situation to come our way. To look at the world with fresh eye’s.

Professional Quality of Life Scale (PROQOL):

What’s up everybody! So for all my upbeat videos, it can seem like all of life as a therapist in private practice is complete bliss.

But when it comes to the type of work that we do, compassion fatigue and burnout are rather common.

And burnout can quickly spiral into serious mental health concerns.

So in this video, I name a few early signs of therapist burnout and offer some tools for how to cope.

This video is geared for therapists of all kinds, including psychologists, MFTs, LPCCs, social workers, and others in the clinical counseling field.

Welcome to Private Practice Skills! I’m Dr. Marie Fang, psychologist in private practice. I post videos offering tools I learned the hard way about starting and growing private practice so that you don’t have to.

This video is not intended as professional or legal advice. Be sure to seek the services of a professional if you are in need of them.

First, let’s answer the question of what IS burnout? In the article’s literature review, they define burnout as “a syndrome of physical and emotional exhaustion resulting from the development of negative self-concept, negative job attitudes, and a loss of concern or feeling for clients,” and describe burnout as “a process, rather than the experience of isolated symptoms otherwise correlated with the syndrome.”

Fortunately, one of the findings of this study is that of the therapists the researchers assessed, those in private practice experienced higher levels of personal accomplishment and lower levels of burnout overall, based on results from the Maslach Burnout Inventory, or MBI.

But that doesn’t mean that those of us in private practice are exempt from burnout. Here are a few signs of burnout to watch for, falling into three major categories:

Physical signs:
Chronic Fatigue
gastrointestinal problems
insomnia
headaches
hypertension

Emotional Indicators:
feelings of hopelessness, futility, and despair
boredom and cynicism
anxiety, withdrawal, and irritability
loss of morale, feelings of isolation, and depression and suicidal ideation

The third dimension reflects signs of exhaustion:
lowered self-concept
increasing inflexibility
distancing from clients
treating clients as cases rather than as people
disbelief in effectiveness
increased family and social conflict

I hope you found this video to help you watch for signs of burnout, or possibly to address burnout that’s already been creeping up on you. Let me know in the comments if you would add any tools to cope with burnout beyond what I’ve listed here. And until next time, from one therapist to another: I wish you well!

When you're anxious, does it cause you to avoid situations that make you afraid in the first place? You may be doing more hard than good. Avoidance doesn't help you learn that (a) you CAN handle fear and, (b) it doesn't work if we cannot always control our environment. AND because so much is out of our control it leads to broader fears of things getting out of control or being uncertain. The more you face your fears you'll learn that anxiety is not as big a deal because you know you have the INTERNAL resources to cope. This vlog explains this idea in a little more detail and using a simple example.

Rejuvenating energy levels,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGu_VCSRwvE,"360° Rejuvenation | Listen Once | Energy Charged Subliminal Activation",The Quantum Subliminalist ,unknown,"108","11",0,"9","Restore energy and vitality in your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual bodies by listening to this powerful energy-infused subliminal activation. This video is also meant to clear any blocks to natural revitalization and rejuvenation.

The energy clearing goes to the seed of conception of any specific issue and creates energetic shifts from there, so the results can be long-lasting as they ripple out and positively impact all levels of your being.

How I do the energy healing/clearing - is by using a series of charts and a pendulum, I connect to Source, then I am directed to the areas that need clearing for you. With this method, all your bodies and levels of being will be cleared of negative programming, blocks, traumas, stored memories, and more. Please make sure to listen until the end, so you can receive the whole benefits of the healing.
The subliminal affirmations bring in the positive programming, to replace the negative subconscious beliefs that I just cleared. The subconscious mind picks up the subliminal messages more easily as they bypass the conscious mind. 

Affirmations used in the video:  
    • My physical body is completely rejuvenated
    • My mental body is completely rejuvenated
    • My emotional body is completely rejuvenated
    • My energetic body is completely rejuvenated
    • My spiritual bodies are completely rejuvenated
    • I am feeling rejuvenated on all levels
    • My energy batteries are restored to optimum levels
    • My energy field is fresh, clean, and cleared of all old energy
    • I can rejuvenate myself anytime I feel the need to
    • I am feeling reborn in this new, fresh energy

The subliminal affirmations and energy healing are all layered in the video/audio, with the music being played on top. The healing recording is in the background of the video at a very low volume so that it creates lasting results by bypassing the conscious mind (like subliminals). 
The subliminal healing is very powerful, this is why you can listen as often as you feel guided to, 21 days in a row a few times, or anytime you feel the need.

It can take a few days for the healing to be integrated, so make sure you take the time to rest and drink plenty of water.

Headphones can be used, but are not necessary.

FURTHER READING

You can read more on this and other subjects on our blog, here:  https://bit.ly/2DwEVqF

“It seems odd at first to imagine that we might get angry, even maddened, by a partner because they were, in the course of a discussion, proving to be too reasonable and too logical. We are used to thinking highly of reason and logic. We are not normally enemies of evidence and rationality. How then could these ingredients become problematic in the course of love? But from close up, considered with sufficient imagination, our suspicion can make a lot of sense.
When we are in difficulties what we may primarily be seeking from our partners is a sense that they understand what we are going through. We are not looking for answers (the problems may be too large for there to be any obvious ones) so much as comfort, reassurance and fellow-feeling. In the circumstances, the deployment of an overly logical stance may come across not as an act of kindness, but as a species of disguised impatience.”

Cultivating a harmonious inner world means finding a sense of balance, peace, and contentment within oneself.
