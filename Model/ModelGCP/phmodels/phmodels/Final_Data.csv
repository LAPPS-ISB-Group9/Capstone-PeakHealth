Building career fulfillment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKlx1DLa9EA,"To find work you love, don't follow your passion | Benjamin Todd | TEDxYouth@Tallinn",TEDx Talks,unknown,6126878,148860,0,5942,"Mainstream career advice tells us to ‚Äúfollow our passion‚Äù, but this advice is dead wrong. Research shows that people who take this approach are ultimately no more likely to enjoy or excel at their jobs. Instead, if you‚Äôre looking for a fulfilling career, here‚Äôs a new slogan to live by: Do what‚Äôs valuable.


Benjamin Todd is the co-founder and Executive Director of 80,000 Hours, an Oxford-based charity dedicated to helping people find fulfilling careers that make a real difference. In three years, 80,000 Hours has grown from a student society to a thriving charity featured on the BBC, the Washington Post, NPR and more, and whose online careers guide has been viewed by hundreds of thousands of people.
Benjamin Todd on heategevusorganisatsiooni 80 000 Hours kaasasutaja, nende eesm√§rk on aidata inimesi, kes tahavad suurendada oma karj√§√§ri positiivset m√µju maailmale.

This is how I became a software developer with no experience, how i became an interior designer with no experience, and how i started on youtube. I quit ""my dream job"" as an actor and have been so much happier since. If you have ever wondered ""Should i quit my job"", ""Is it worth a paycut"" or ""What will people say about me""...I have lots of thoughts to share with you.

I wanted to make this video because I find myself having this conversation with so many friends, family members and even strangers -- The Great Resignation is among us. Something is in the air, and if you are miserable in your work or in your life...there is another way. 

Change is hard. But slowly and imperceptibly, things do change. And they can change for the better. 

I think I'll be doing videos in the future going into greater depth on how I got into each of these individual careers. So leave any questions you have in the comments and I'll cover more in a future video!

Thanks for indulging 40 straight minutes of me yelling. 
Lots of love,
üß°
Caroline

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

Script:

In case you hadn‚Äôt noticed, life is difficult, complex and unpredictable. You can‚Äôt change this. It‚Äôs the nature of things. But you can prepare yourself for the next unwelcome surprise. 

How? By building resilience.

Resilience is the ability to bounce back from life‚Äôs inevitable disappointments, failures, and pains.

Let me use an analogy here. 

If cars didn‚Äôt have shock absorbers, every ride would be a miserable experience. The ride through life without shock absorbers ‚Äì that is, resilience ‚Äì would be the same. So, without building resilience ‚Äì your own internal shock absorbers ‚Äì it‚Äôs not possible to lead a happy and productive life. 

Resilience is the opposite of fragility. To be fragile means that just about everything upsets you. And if just about everything upsets you, you will spend a lot of time angry and hurt. And if you spend a lot of time angry and hurt, you will not be a happy person.
 
Here, I‚Äôm not focusing on severe illness, the death of a loved one or any crushing life-changing event. In such cases, people usually need help to recover. But for most of us, such situations are rare ‚Äì while the slights and disappointments of ordinary life are not. And for those, we need resilience.
 
OK, then. How do you develop resilience? Here are some suggestions to get you started, drawn from my forty-plus years as a psychiatrist. 

First, get some perspective. 

Step back and assess your situation with as much objectivity as you can. ‚ÄúHow bad is this problem?‚Äù ‚ÄúHave I overstated it?‚Äù 

Sometimes my patients think an unhappy occurrence is much more serious than it really is ‚Äì usually because it‚Äôs amplified by evoking a painful childhood issue. Often getting perspective is as simple as asking yourself this question: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the worst thing that can happen?‚Äù Usually you‚Äôll discover the worst thing isn‚Äôt that bad ‚Äì and isn‚Äôt even likely to happen. 

Second, compare the undeserved bad things that have happened to you with the unearned good things that have happened to you. 

When I ask my patients to do this, they invariably conclude that the unearned good in their life far outweighs the undeserved bad. I‚Äôd say the ratio is at least 10 to 1. In my own case, I didn‚Äôt earn the incredibly good fortune of my grandparents moving to America, or that life-saving penicillin was available to me in my childhood when I was sick. I could go on and on. And so could you. 

In light of this, maybe things aren‚Äôt so bad after all. In fact, they‚Äôre probably pretty good. 

Third, toughen up. 

Life hits you from all directions ‚Äì health, personal relationships, work challenges, family issues. To deal with them, you need to build up your mental toughness. The earlier in life one starts this process, the better. 

That‚Äôs why parents who coddle their children and protect them from every hurt and failure are not doing them any favors. Nor are colleges that provide students with so-called ‚Äúsafe spaces.‚Äù To toughen up, you need to push yourself. How do you know what you‚Äôre capable of if you don‚Äôt do that?

It‚Äôs important to develop good relationships at work. They improve happiness, trust and engagement. Here are five ways to build strong, positive relationships at work! 

1. Schedule time to build relationships. Pop over to a colleague‚Äôs desk, offer a coffee, or reply to a social media post. Devote time to building relationships, even if it‚Äôs just a few minutes a day.

2. Develop your emotional intelligence. Understanding your own emotional needs can help you to empathize with others.

3. Appreciate others. Everyone wants to feel appreciated. Whether it‚Äôs the CEO or the janitor, show your appreciation by complimenting a job well done.

4. Manage your boundaries. Building friendships is important. But if a relationship becomes distracting, it‚Äôs important to take action. Set clear boundaries around when and where it‚Äôs acceptable to socialize.

5. Avoid gossiping. If you are experiencing conflict with a colleague, gossiping will only exacerbate the problem. Instead, talk directly to the person involved and find a way to work together amicably.

https://courses.therapyinanutshell.com/emotion-processing?utm_campaign=May%207,%202021&utm_medium=Description&utm_source=YouTube

Coping skills can be really important for anxiety. They often soothe or comfort us, and they help us calm down and make better choices. However, coping skills do nothing to solve our problems in the long term, and some of them, if used exclusively, can be harmful. Coping skills help us take a break from our discomfort, but also from our life purpose. So that‚Äôs why I get a little bugged when I hear that the only skill someone is learning in therapy is how to cope. 
Using coping skills to get through a crisis and get calm and then coming back and resolving the problem is the best long-term practice. This ability to pause before choosing an action is an essential skill of emotionally resilient people.

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction.

This stress affects people in different ways. Take a moment to notice and accept your feelings. These are normal reactions to an abnormal situation. It is important to take time to care for our mental health during COVID-19 and other periods of heightened stress.

Avoid coping strategies that will make you feel worse and instead use strategies like talking about your experience, spending time with loved ones, getting your news from reliable sources and taking care of yourself physically, mentally, and spiritually. 

Remember, you are not alone. If there is violence in your home or if you are thinking of hurting yourself or others, talk to a trusted friend, family member or counselor or call your local emergency hotlines. There is help in your community.

Coping with work pressure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3CU2kOBt3s,Coping With Uncertainty,MindToolsVideos,unknown,96904,1982,0,40,"To learn more about coping with uncertainty and dealing with stress, discover our range of tools at: https://www.mindtools.com/pages/main/newMN_TCS.htm?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=copingwithuncertainty&utm_content=description

The world is an uncertain place. Things change fast, and it can be difficult to see what's coming next.

But with the right approach, you can make things easier for yourself, learn to be comfortable with uncertainty, and be prepared for whatever the future brings.

Here are six simple strategies for coping when things get messy.

Fear is a natural reaction to uncertainty, but you can't let it rule you.

Worrying about the future is pointless. So don't ask, ""What if?"" Ask, ""What will I do if?""

Knowing how you will react if things do go badly takes a lot of the sting out of the worry. Feeling out of control can be scary. 

So, instead of fretting about the things you can't affect, focus on the things you can. Work out what you can do, and do it.

You'll probably feel better for knowing you're doing something useful. Plan for various possibilities, not just the outcome you think is most likely.

Build in contingencies so that, whatever happens, you're in a solid position to deal with whatever comes next. Being agile means you're able to respond quickly to differing needs or adapt to changing circumstances.

Think about developing new skills, which would not only make you more valuable, but give you new career options too.

At the same time, be alert. Stay on top of changes that could affect you and your business. The sooner you know about something, the quicker you can react!

Uncertainty can cause anxiety and stress, which can damage your health and get you stuck in a vicious circle. Exercise helps clear stress hormones from your body, while meditation and mindfulness can help you relax and reduce anxiety.

Talking to someone you trust can also help you find perspective ‚Äì a problem shared is a problem halved.

One of the greatest causes of unhappiness and stress in uncertain times can be comparing how we think things ""should"" be with how they are.

But ask yourself, ""According to whom?"" Often, the answer is ""nobody."" It's always good to have goals, but make them your aspirations, not your expectations.

If you can accept uncertainty for what it is, prepare yourself for various outcomes, address your worries head-on, and manage your personal stress levels, you'll cope much better in ""interesting"" times.

And, hopefully, put yourself in a position to deal with whatever comes your way.",0,0:04:01,Education,"['stress management', 'uncertainty', 'change', 'readiness', 'prepare', 'challenge']",,youtube,,Coping with work pressure_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3CU2kOBt3s,Emotional exhaustion,Yes,Akash,

By developing genuine gratitude for others, Joseph believes we can all react more positively to fear in any form.
 
Joseph Lewis is a law enforcement officer for DC Metro, a community advocate for the Lutheran Immigration Refugee Service, a seminary student, and a former refugee. Born in Liberia, he lived a normal life up until 1989, when a civil war broke out in the area. After facing multiple setbacks for the remainder of his childhood and the beginning of his adult life, Joseph migrated to the United States where he settled into a life of homelessness. Encouragement from those in his local community inspired Joseph to go to college and earn a degree. Through his experiences, Joseph has become a key community figure and source of inspiration, actively telling his story and encouraging others to do the same.

When you're anxious, does it cause you to avoid situations that make you afraid in the first place? You may be doing more hard than good. Avoidance doesn't help you learn that (a) you CAN handle fear and, (b) it doesn't work if we cannot always control our environment. AND because so much is out of our control it leads to broader fears of things getting out of control or being uncertain. The more you face your fears you'll learn that anxiety is not as big a deal because you know you have the INTERNAL resources to cope. This vlog explains this idea in a little more detail and using a simple example.

Most people are genetically gifted with empathy; however, some have to learn this skill. For instance, therapists are taught 'empathy' before they can attend to clients.

There is a powerful connection between your emotions, intuition, and empathy. The magic comes when you learn how to tap into each of them to access your sensitivities without going on overload or becoming drained by challenging or stressful situations at work. Learning how to keep your center and avoid burnout in all situations is important to identify emotional triggers so you can master strategies to own the moment in your interactions.

Dr. Orloff is a psychiatrist, an empath and is on the UCLA Psychiatric Clinical Faculty. She synthesizes the pearls of traditional medicine with cutting edge knowledge of intuition, empathy, and energy awareness. She also specializes in treating empaths and highly sensitive people in her private practice and does online sessions with individuals and businesses internationally. Her work has been featured in O Magazine, Forbes, Business Insider, The London Sunday Times, CNN, The Today Show, PBS, BBC and NPR.

I discuss the immensely powerful chemical that we all make in our brain and body: dopamine. I describe what it does and the neural circuits involved. I explain dopamine peaks and baselines, and the cell biology of dopamine depletion. I include 14 tools for how to control your dopamine release for sake of motivation, focus, avoiding and combating addiction and depression, and I explain why dopamine stacking with chemicals and behaviors inevitably leads to states of underwhelm and poor performance. I explain how to achieve sustained increases in baseline dopamine, compounds that injure and protect dopamine neurons including caffeine from specific sources. I describe non-prescription supplements for increasing dopamine‚Äîboth their benefits and risks‚Äîand synergy of pro-dopamine supplements with those that increase acetylcholine.

--

Socrates, one of the founding fathers of Western philosophical thought, was on trial. Many believed he was an enemy of the state, accusing the philosopher of corrupting the youth and refusing to recognize their gods. But Socrates wasn‚Äôt feared for claiming to have all the answers, but rather, for asking too many questions. Erick Wilberding digs into the technique known as the Socratic Method.

I describe how dopamine, a chemical we all make in our brain, underlies our desire for and pursuit of our goals, as well as our capacity to move and experience pleasure. I describe how we can leverage specific behaviors, reward schedules and dopamine-prolactin balance to help ensure we can maintain motivation and capacity for pleasure over the long term. I also discuss dopamine in the context of ADHD, craving and addiction, and some absolutely amazing results about specificity of drug effects based purely on belief.

He has made numerous significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function and neural plasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to rewire and learn new behaviors, skills and cognitive functioning. 

Huberman is a McKnight Foundation and Pew Foundation Fellow and was awarded the Cogan Award in 2017, given to the scientist making the most significant discoveries in the study of vision. His lab‚Äôs most recent work focuses on the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. He also works on neural regeneration and directs a clinical trial to promote visual restoration in diseases that cause blindness. Huberman is also actively involved in developing tools now in use by the elite military in the U.S. and Canada, athletes, and technology industries to optimize performance in high stress environments, enhance neural plasticity, mitigate stress, and optimize sleep. 

Work from the Huberman Laboratory at Stanford School of Medicine has been published in top journals including Nature, Science, and Cell and has been featured in TIME, BBC, Scientific American, Discover, and other top media outlets.

In 2021, Dr. Huberman launched the Huberman Lab Podcast. The podcast is frequently ranked in the Top 25 of all podcasts globally and is often ranked #1 in the categories of Science, Education, and Health & Fitness.

Knowing how to motivate a team is a great skill for any manager to have and everyone can learn how to motivate. Engaged and motivated teams perform a lot better and are much nicer places to work ‚Äì great for everyone.

So the first method to motivate a team is to share your vision with your team. Explain the direction and goals you want to achieve. Explain how this fits in with the company goals and why each team member has an important role to play. 

The second way to motivate your team is to understand the goals of each team member. Everyone is different and have different hopes and dreams. Take each person through how achieving the company and team goals can also help the individual achieve some of their goals. 

Leading by example is another way for motivating your team at work. I always found it very motivational being in a team with a hardworking successful manager who lives by the same rules they set for everyone. Leading by example is great for how to motivate and inspire employees.


How to motivate team members as a leader includes actively developing team members. There are so many ways to develop team members without needing a large budget. Plan out what you can do to move each person in your team forward and keep them learning.

When thinking to ways to motivate your team, praising regularly should feature highly. We all want praise for work well done and as a manager, look for opportunities to praise employees. Positive reinforcement really does work. 

The sixth method to motivate a team is to proactively remove blockers. Having to fight against blockers is painful and demotivating. Look at your processes. Deal with conflict and underperformers. Deal with disruptive staff. Take action.

Seventh, for how to motivate employees ‚Äì practice a positive management style. There are many behaviours and actions that go into a positive management style ‚Äì some we have covered already. Additional ones include promoting open communication, being consistent and spending time listening to your team members. These are all great actions to motivate your team

Put into practice at least one of the methods outlined in ‚Äú7 methods to Motivate your team‚Äù. Once you have this up and running, put into action the next one. It won‚Äôt be long before you have them all running, and you will quickly see the impact on team motivation.

Enjoy working with a more motivated team!

Did you know that most of us spend 13 hours a day sitting down?

All of this inactivity has the potential to cause serious health problems. But, it can be hard to stay fit and healthy when you have a sedentary job. 

So, here are six tips for boosting your health and well-being at work‚Ä¶

1.Build activity into your commute. Why not walk, cycle or jog part of the way to work? Or, if you take public transport, get off one stop early and walk the rest of the way. 

2. Take regular screen breaks. Aim to get away from your desk for a few minutes every hour. Chat to a colleague rather than emailing them, take a phone call while standing, or take a look out of the window.

3. Use the stairs. Forget the elevator and take the stairs. Doing this will help to build up your aerobic capacity, raise your heart rate, and increase your muscle strength.

4. Hold stand-up or walking meetings. Not only will this get you up, it will make your meetings fun, creative and productive.

5. Go outside for lunch. Make an effort to leave your desk for lunch, even if it‚Äôs just for a short walk around the block. This will boost blood circulation, flex your joints, and give you time for mental recharging and reflection.

6. Eat well! To be truly effective, healthy behavior has to combine exercise and diet. So, prepare something that‚Äôs both nutritious and delicious!",0,0:02:05,Education,"['health', 'well-being', 'wellbeing', 'dangers of sitting', 'health at work', 'screen breaks', 'stress', 'workplace', 'stand-up meetings', 'walking meetings', 'fitness']",,youtube,,Enhancing well-being at work_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGlACnI7iXc,Emotional exhaustion,Yes,Pranjal,

Communication in relationships is very important. In this dating and relationships advice video, I share with you 7 keys to effective communication. To have a healthy and successful relationship, you need to embrace all the 7 keys to effective communication that I discuss in this relationship advice video.

Many relationships fail because of communication issues and this video will give you 7 keys to effective communication in your relationship to make your relationship better. People fail to sit down talk about their communication issues and express themselves properly. We need to learn how to talk to each other and how to listen actively and properly and these communication tips will help you improve your communication skills.

In this video, I give you relationship advice that will assist you in establishing effective communication for improving your communication skills in your relationship so that you can make your relationship better. 

One of the biggest problems is that when people try to talk to each other, the person listening is simply waiting for their chance to counter your argument. They are waiting for their chance to hit you back or to defend themselves or dismiss what you are saying and that is not going to produce healthy communication.

When someone is speaking, the goal should be to try to understand them and if you do not understand them, you go to asking for more clarity, you go to asking more questions to try to dig deeper so that you can have a clearer understanding of how they are feeling and what they are trying to communicate. 

As a certified life coach, dating coach, and relationship coach who provides relationship and dating advice for women and men, I want to make dating and relationships easier for you, and I pray that you may find this video helpful. 

If you are asking these questions or searching for these issues:

- Is communication in relationships important

- How do I improve my communication skills
- What are the keys to effective communication
- How do I fix communication issues in a relationship

Well, I believe this dating and relationship advice video will give you the clarity you need.

Just apply these tips in your day-to-day interactions. Whether you want to have better conversations in your personal and social life, or get your ideas across better at work, you can learn how to communicate more effectively. It‚Äôs one of the most important life skills you can have.

There are many ways to have a better communication. For example, asking questions will not only help you understand what the other person is saying, it also indicates that you're actually interested in what they‚Äôre saying. And if you want to show that you really understand, then paraphrasing is one of the simplest communication techniques you can use.

The more you pay attention to how you express yourself to others, the more you will improve your communication skills. So give it a try!

Mandy‚Äôs first contact with the world of addiction, mental health and recovery was when she came into treatment in 1990. Her passion for therapy and its potential for change ignited here, inspiring her to make therapy her life‚Äôs work. Alongside a growing private practice Mandy always gave time to promote early intervention through lectures on addiction, emotional coping mechanisms and self-esteem as part of the PSHE (Personal, Social & Health Education) provision within independent schools. In 2008, with a busy private practice and many years of recovery under her belt, Mandy founded CHARTER Harley Street, an outpatient centre treating addiction and trauma using her pioneering model of care.

DBT is an incredibly useful tool when it comes to managing emotions. In fact, there is an entire module of this treatment dedicated to emotional regulation. In this interview, triple board-certified neuropsychologist Dr. Judy Ho and MedCircle host Kyle Kittleson discuss...

1. What role do emotions biologically play in our behavior and how we respond to conflict?
2. What comes first, the behavior or the emotion?
3. How can someone reduce overly emotional responses using mindfulness? 
4. What are the 3 goals of the emotional regulation model of DBT?
5. What are some examples of how we tend to be vulnerable towards emotions like sadness, denial, anger, fear, and happiness?
6. What are some ways people may incorrectly express their emotion?
7. How can someone start utilizing ""emotion words""?

But what is really going on?

Michelle Ryan is a Professor of Social and Organisational Psychology and Dean of Postgraduate Research at the University of Exeter, UK, and Professor of Diversity at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands.

With colleagues she has uncovered the phenomenon of the glass cliff, whereby women (and members of other minority groups) are more likely to be placed in leadership positions which are risky or precarious.

We all have roles to play: manager, parent, friend, partner. But when one of these takes over, itâ€™s normal to feel as if your life is out of balance. 

Absenteeism, low productivity and poor mental health - all are potential symptoms of poor work-life balance. So if youâ€™re out of sorts, use these five tips to restore harmony.

1. Audit your time. Make a note of all your professional and personal commitments. Which ones are most valuable to you? Which are taking up too much of your time?

2. Improve your efficiency.  Limiting distractions will help you to work more productively and to focus on the tasks that really matter.

3. Add flexibility. Feeling trapped by strict working conditions? Try out the freedom of flexi-time, or working from home.

4. Find time for yourself. When you neglect your own well-being, you are no longer your best self in any part of your life. Donâ€™t forget to set aside some â€œme timeâ€ every day.

5. Enjoy yourself. Time flies when youâ€™re having fun, and the same applies to your work. An engaging workload will be more enjoyable, no matter how busy you are. Find meaning in your work and reap the rewards of job satisfaction!",0,0:02:02,Education,"['flexible', 'balance', 'wellbeing', 'lifestyle', 'efficient', 'job satisfaction']",,youtube,,Work-life balance strategies_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSSTdjwrlco,Personal achievement,Yes,Prajukta,

""[The concept of] Work-Life Balance sets us up to strive for something that is unreachable.""

Are you struggling to find time to balance your work and personal life? In this video, we're going to explore the topic of work life balance. ""Balance"" might not be the best way to view how our work life and personal life overlap... which begs the question, is 'work life balance' a myth?

According to clinical psychologist Dr. Jenny Yip, work-life balance may be an outdated term that misrepresents the reciprocal relationship between our work life and home life. We spend so much time at work and with coworkersâ€”they're bound to overlap. Discover why this term may be misleading, and what to do instead.

Part of replacing work life balance with life awareness and integration starts with self talk, and psychology backed self care - Dr. Jenny Yip explains the relationship and shares tips for improving self talk and self care strategies in this video.

The fact is, you are not completely wrong.

If you do want to be successful, you do need to work hard and hustle but the key is in the duration of time that you are hustling for.

Earlier this year while at our 2CCX Mastermind in Paradise event in Mexico, I gave a presentation where I explain how I achieve work life balance through periods of radical imbalance. 

In this presentation I share the two types of goals everyone should be reaching for as a business owner and/or entrepreneur. 

Once you understand the difference, you will no longer wonder how work life balance is even possible for entrepreneurs.

Are you struggling to achieve work/life balance?

So was I...

... actually, I sucked at it.

I was that guy that would show up to parties and family functions strapped to his laptop  - donâ€™t judge :).

I self-justified with the belief that it was all o.k because I was driven and the â€œhatersâ€ simply didnâ€™t get it.

This flawed mindset cost me my friendships, my relationship at the time, and my health. 

I put on 20lbs (not muscle).

The struggle was brutal.

I didnâ€™t want to stop building and scaling companies, but I didnâ€™t want to end up alone, sick or dead either.

And it wasnâ€™t until after selling my company Spheric that I really took some time to reflect and ask myself if there was a better way. 

Turns out there is... a much better way.

I call it work-life integration. 

Thatâ€™s what I want to share with you in today's video...

Not only do I share my approach to integrating life into work, but I also talk about the 7 pillars of life that must be kept in harmony.

Here they are:

1. Health
2. Love
3. Friends
4. Finances
5. Mission
6. Hobby
7. Spirituality

Being aware of these pillars is great. 

Integrating them into your life is where transformation truly occurs.

Watch the video to learn how I track, measure and integrate them on a weekly basis to ensure my business growsâ€¦ while my health and relationships continue to thrive. 

Also, I want to share a strategy called â€œNETâ€ time (stands for No Extra Time) that I use to really get the most out of my day.

(after reading over 200+ personal development and productivity books, etc. I can confidently say that you wonâ€™t find this tip anywhere else)

Dive in now and learn how to start living a deeply integrated entrepreneurial life. 

With gratitude,

â€“ Dan

Don't forget to share this entrepreneurial advice with your friends, so they can learn too: https://youtu.be/CgVQIBK6voI


=====================
ABOUT DAN MARTELL
=====================

â€œYou can only keep what you give away.â€ Thatâ€™s the mantra thatâ€™s shaped Dan Martell from a struggling 20-something business owner in the Canadian Maritimes (which is waaay out east) to a successful startup founder whoâ€™s raised more than $3 million in venture funding and exited not one... not two... but three tech businesses: Clarity.fm, Spheric and Flowtown.

You can only keep what you give away. That philosophy has led Dan to invest in 33+ early stage startups such as Udemy, Intercom, Unbounce and Foodspotting. Itâ€™s also helped him shape the future of Hootsuite as an advisor to the social media tour de force. 

An activator, a tech geek, an adrenaline junkie and, yes, a romantic (ask his wife Renee), Dan has recently turned his attention to teaching startups a fundamental, little-discussed lesson that directly impacts their growth: how to scale. Youâ€™ll find not only incredible insights in every moment of every talk Dan gives - but also highly actionable takeaways that will propel your business forward. Because Dan gives freely of all that he knows. After all, you can only keep what you give away.

Work-life balance strategies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq4E79OkOwc,Establishing a Work/Life Balance,GaryVee,unknown,7195,134,0,4,"From early on in my relationship with my wife (I think it was the 2nd date), I communicated to her that if time goes on and I still didn't have my NY Jets, I was going to be working harder and was going to be a lot more busy :) I usually don't like discussing this subject because it's admittedly still something I struggle with, but the truth behind it all is that in order to have a true work/life balance, there needs to be communication between a person and their loved ones. 

Lizzie and I have a crazy scenario where I'm typically all-in with work Monday thru Friday and then when it comes to weekends, I turn everything off to spend time with my wife and kids. We've also began taking a lot more vacations to make up for time ""lost"" during the week. 

The moral of the story is that we communicated from day one about how we were going to make things work. As with many things with life, communication is crucial. So, as I've said over and over again, this boils down to context. Once you understand the situation you can ""hack"" your way to making it work for everyone involved.

In this practical talk, Doerr shows us how we can get back on track with ""Objectives and Key Results,"" or OKRs -- a goal-setting system that's been employed by the likes of Google, Intel and Bono to set and execute on audacious goals. Learn more about how setting the right goals can mean the difference between success and failure -- and how we can use OKRs to hold our leaders and ourselves accountable.

Goal Setting is not difficult if it is done properly.  So watch this video if you want to set and achieve your most precious goals. 

The problem is everyone wants life to be greater but almost all of us get stuck at times or something prevents us from doing what we really are capable of doing whether shifting a relationship, turning around our finances, getting in proper shape. Instead of being happy, we get stuck with the belief of how we are not supposed to be, what we are not supposed to do, what we are not capable of. We are stuck in the emotional pattern of being pissed off or being frustrated. Sometimes we are stuck in our habits of doing things in certain ways and that is because we lack proper planning and proper motivation to achieve our goals. 

So the first step to achieve your goals is knowing yourself. 
Step 2 is to set your goals.

Some define him as an expert institutional investor, while others know him as a large scale installation artist, avid outdoorsman, professor, decision strategist, coach, business leader, mindfulness extremist, author, speaker, daredevil or Guinness world record holder. In his talk, Stephen explains that what truly defines him aren't titles, but an approach to decision making that transformed him from someone who struggled with simple tasks to a guy who is continuously achieving even his most ambitious dreams.

For thirty years, he has applied cognitive science to investing, business and life. The result has been the turnaround of numerous institutional businesses, career best returns for managers who have adopted his methods, the development of a $1.25 billion dollar hedge fund and a rapidly shrinking bucket list.
Mr. Duneier teaches graduate courses on Decision Analysis in UCSBâ€™s College of Engineering. His book, AlphaBrain is due for release in early 2017 from Wiley & Sons.
Through Bija Advisors, he helps business leaders improve performance by applying proven, proprietary decision-making methods to their own processes.
His artwork has been featured around the world and is represented by the Sullivan Goss Gallery. As Commissioner of the League of Professional Educators, Duneier is using cognitive science to alter the landscape of American education. He is the former Head of Currency Option Trading at Bank of America and Emerging Markets at AIG International.

---TRANSCRIPT---
Thanks for stopping by, this is 2 Minute Classroom and today we are talking about setting goals using the SMART method. 

Goal setting is a great activity anytime but is especially popular around New Years', at the start of the school year, and the beginning of a sports season. I would love to hear some of your goals in the comments and Iâ€™ll put some of mine in the description below. 
 
SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

Weâ€™ll go through each of these using the example goal of â€œdoing well on your next examâ€ - A common goal for students.

The first step is to make the goal specific. â€œDoing well on your next examâ€ is not specific. Try to answer the questions of what, when, and why.

Letâ€™s specify your what as scoring at least 90% on your next science exam.

For the when it will be whenever the exam is, letâ€™s say itâ€™s in 4 weeks.

The why is very important as this is your motivation for the goal and something you can look back on if you get discouraged. 

It could be to improve your grade in the course, to score higher than a friend, or because you want to get into a great university. Whatever will motivate you to keep working on the goal. 

So now we have a much more specific goal â€œScore at least 90% on the next science exam four weeks from now to help you get into a great university.â€ 

This goal is looking great, but we are not done yet. 

The next step is to make sure the goal is measurable. That means there are some metrics attached to the goal to let you know if you reach your goal or not. 

Looking back at our goal we see that it is to score at least 90%. This is very measurable and once youâ€™ve taken the test and received a score you will know whether or not you hit the goal. 

This is also why â€œDoing well on your next examâ€ is a poor goal - it is not measurable and there is no clear way to define success or failure. 

The next step is to check whether the goal is achievable or not. In this step you want to break the goal down and answer the question of â€œhowâ€ you will achieve this goal. What do you need to do in the next four weeks to get at least 90% on the exam. 

Some examples may include taking notes in class, spending 30 minutes three nights per week studying for the exam, and partnering with a friend a week before the exam to review notes and go through a study guide. 

The point is you need a plan. Break the goal down into smaller goals that all feed up to the main goal. This will give you a clear path to success.

The fourth step is to ensure the goal is relevant. 

This step is more of a gut check to see if it fits well in your life right now. Ask yourself the following questions: Does this align with my long-term objectives? Does it keep me on track for other goals in your life? Will focusing on this goal pull me away from other, more important goals?

After thinking through this step you should feel confident your goal is relevant and be even more motivated to achieve it. 

Scoring at least 90% on your next science exam is relevant because it will give you confidence in school and feed into larger goals around future education and career. 

The last step is to make the goal time-bound. 

A time-bound deadline acts as a target and helps you work backward and set smaller steps to get there. If you set a fitness goal to be able to do 100 consecutive pushups but donâ€™t set a deadline to reach that goal then it probably won't happen.

Hitting a certain score on an exam is time-bound by default because there is a specific date for the exam which allows us to break the goal into smaller steps leading up to the exam. 

And here is a bonus tip. If you truly want to reach your goals then you have to write them down and look at them often. I recommend keeping a daily/weekly planner to track your progress. Iâ€™ve put some excellent planner recommendations in the description that will help make your goals a reality. 

Remember to share your goals in the comments, I will read and respond to as many of them as I can.

While some viewers might find advice provided in this talk to be helpful as a complementary approach, several claims around brain size and lifestyle are not corroborated by sufficient scientific evidence. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf


Chronic stress is devastating for your brain. It ruins your memory, your attention and concentration and your emotional resilience. The brain areas that help execute these functions literally deteriorate. 

Luckily, brain science has revealed many ways to prevent or counteract this. In her talk Niki Korteweg shares the four most important things you can do to keep your brain healthy and working at its very best.

Niki Korteweg is a Dutch science journalist with a PhD in neurobiology, and she has been writing about health and brain science for almost 20 years. Ironically, after experiencing a burnout about 10 years ago, her own brain started to let her down. It was the start of a quest in the scientific literature to discover what actually helps to guard our brain against stress and make it work better than ever.  As a science journalist at NRC Handelsblad with a PhD in neurobiology, Niki is very knowledgeable about brain research, medical science, and psychology. She is a versatile journalist: she writes features, interviews, news articles, and books, gives lectures and teaches about science writing. After experiencing burnout in 2010, Niki published the book â€˜Een beter breinâ€™ (A better brain) in 2017. In this book, she discusses the fast-moving developments in neuroscience and all the ways in which we can use those insights to take good care of our brains. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

When I did my previous video on stress, I got an overwhelming response that for most of you the workplace is your major source of stress. Now, it's normal to have stress in the workplace to a certain degree. You are going to have deadlines you have to meet at work. You are going to have expectations. But when this workplace stress becomes too great, it can actually decrease your productivity. It can decrease your success. And in addition to harming your physical health, workplace stress can roll over into your personal life, your home life, and it can affect your relationships.

So, what can you do? In my last video, I recommended that one way to reduce stress was to remove the stressor. However, for most of us, we need to work to eat, so we can't just leave our jobs most of the time. So, what can we do? If you can't leave your job, yet you can't afford to let stress harm your health, then you need to find ways to reduce this job-related stress. 
Numerous studies have shown that for the majority of American adults, they identify the workplace as the number one source of stress. How do you know if you are being affected by workplace stress? Well, you may experience anxiety and depression while at work, or even when you think about work. You may also have difficulty sleeping, insomnia. You may have a constant fear of losing your job or a fear of not meeting your job's demands. And you may even have some of the physical signs and symptoms, such as fatigue, headache, hypertension, chest pain. And you may even be more prone to infections.

Fatigue describes a state of tiredness that does not resolve with rest or sleep.[1] In general usage, fatigue is synonymous with extreme tiredness or exhaustion that normally follows prolonged physical or mental activity. When it does not resolve after rest or sleep, or occurs independently of physical or mental exertion, it may be a symptom of a medical condition that may become severe or progressive.[2]

Fatigue can be a feature of a mental disorder such as depression; may be associated with conditions of chronic pain such as fibromyalgia; it may also feature in conditions of chronic low-level inflammation, and be a disease-related symptom in many other conditions.[3] Fatigue often has no known cause, and is recognised as being very complex in nature.[4] Fatigability describes a susceptibility to fatigue.[5]

Physical fatigue results from muscle fatigue brought about by intense physical activity.[6][7][8] Mental fatigue results from prolonged periods of cognitive activity which impairs cognitive ability. Mental fatigue can manifest as sleepiness, lethargy, or directed attention fatigue.[9] Mental fatigue can also impair physical performance.[10]",0,0:03:11,People & Blogs,[],,youtube,,Overcoming mental fatigue_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyXVuO2Arc,Emotional exhaustion,Yes,LKS,

Aside from making time for exercise, eating a proper diet, and getting enough sleep each night, there are other things we need to consider and incorporate into our life to help us recover from burnout. Some things to consider are how long of a break or vacation we need to take to give our brain time to heal? Have you ever come back from a vacation and felt totally rested? Or maybe you come back just as stressed out. Think about this for a bit, and also consider the type of break you need. Maybe you need to sit around and do nothing for 7 days, or maybe you like to get outside and hike or bike, or perhaps you prefer to see the world and experience different cultures. Take some time to consider what types of breaks you need and how often you need them.

It is time that we extend the same empathy and aid to mental health as we do to physical health.

Hailey Hardcastle is a freshman at the University of Oregon and a student mental health advocate. This year she was named one of Teen Vogues 21 under 21 most influential young people for her work on passing House Bill 2191, which allows students to take mental health days off from school.

About Me:
I‚Äôm Emma McAdam. I‚Äôm a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, and I have worked in various settings of change and growth since 2004. My experience includes juvenile corrections, adventure therapy programs, wilderness therapy programs, an eating disorder treatment center, a residential treatment center, and I currently work in an outpatient therapy clinic.  

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction. 
And deeper than all of that, the Gospel of Jesus Christ orients my personal worldview and sense of security, peace, hope, and love https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe

‚ÄúWhen we fail and mess up in our lives (perhaps a project at work goes wrong or a relationship ends), our moods are at risk of heading towards two extremes: self-pity on the one hand, where it is exclusively everyone else‚Äôs fault and we bathe in a sense of our innocence and purity. And on the other, self-flagellation, where we blame only ourselves, tear ourselves apart and constantly replay evidence of our waywardness and sheer stupidity...‚Äù

Dr. Kristin Neff is an Insight Meditation practitioner and an associate professor of Educational Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin.

Its companion, The Mindful Self-Compassion Workbook, went on to become a bestseller, providing science-backed, step-by-step guidance for tapping your inner resources and transforming the way you work and live.

Meditation is generally considered to be safe for people in good health. Research suggests that practicing meditation may lower blood pressure, reduce symptoms of IBS, anxiety, depression and insomnia. Research suggests that meditation may physically change the brain and body and could potentially help to improve certain health problems and increase healthy behaviours. It has also been shown that meditation may slow, delay, or even reverse changes that take place in the brain due to the effects of ageing. Don‚Äôt use meditation to replace conventional care or as a reason to postpone seeing a medical provider about a health problem. Do not meditate while driving or operating heavy machinery. In the unlikely event that you experience any unusual physical or mental discomfort, discontinue use immediately. There have been rare reports that meditation could cause or worsen symptoms in people with certain psychiatric problems such as anxiety and depression. People with existing mental health conditions should speak with their health care providers before starting meditation.

In November 2021, Dr. Peterson traveled to the United Kingdom to give a series of lectures at Oxford and Cambridge. This lecture was given at Lady Mitchell Hall at the University of Cambridge on November 23rd, 2021.

Dr. Peterson gives an in-depth exploration of the problem of perception. In doing so, he touches on orienting reflexes, artificial intelligence, the infinite possibilities parsed by perception, neurophysiology, postmodernism, and the relationship between imitation, awe, and the divine, before answering questions from the audience about the direction of Western civilization, meaning, and the notion of humans as simple biological machines.

Clip taken from Andrew Huberman's podcast episode #104 



Jocko Willink is a retired Navy SEAL officer and author of multiple books on effective leadership and teamwork, self-discipline and mindset, and host of the Jocko Podcast. We discuss how people can build and sculpt their identity and psychology through specific mindsets and actions and how to adapt the self to novel and challenging situations, using specific daily routines. We consider how ‚Äúenergy‚Äù actually stems from physical action and describe practical tools and scientific mechanisms for leveraging exercise, cold exposure, nutrition, fasting, hydration, sunlight, mindset and music to make us feel more energized and what that, in turn, does for our life. Jocko explains how discipline and specific daily routines allow for productivity and creativity.  And we discuss the qualities of successful leaders, including how to build confidence and real bonds when working with a team or family/friends. Jocko describes a particularly powerful tool of using perspective shifts to allow for ‚Äòdetachment‚Äô as a unique way to identify novel solutions to problems. We also discuss the power of early developmental narratives and how experiences of friendship, love, connection and loss can serve as pillars for making us better human beings in all aspects of life. Our conversation covers a wide range of topics, including mental health, physical health and performance, and provides actionable tools that anyone, regardless of age or profession, can apply to live a more effective and meaningful life.

John Gretton ""Jocko"" Willink (born September 8, 1971)[2] is an American author, podcaster, and retired United States Navy officer who served in the Navy SEALs and is a former member of SEAL Team 3.

Willink's military service includes combat actions in the Iraq War, where he commanded SEAL Team 3's Task Unit Bruiser,[3] the unit that fought in the battle against the Iraqi insurgents in Ramadi.[4] Willink was honored with the Silver Star and Bronze Star Medal for his service.[5] He achieved the rank of lieutenant commander.[6]

Willink co-authored the books Extreme Ownership and The Dichotomy of Leadership (with fellow retired SEAL Leif Babin) and co-founded the management consulting firm Echelon Front, LLC.[6] Willink hosts a weekly podcast with Brazilian jiu jitsu practitioner Echo Charles, called the Jocko Podcast.[7][6] He holds a B.A. in English from the University of San Diego.[6]

After Navy recruit training and Radioman (RM) ""A"" School training, Willink reported to Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training (BUD/S) training at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado. Willink graduated BUD/S class 177.[8] Following SEAL tactical training (STT) and completion of six-month probationary period, he received the NEC 5326 as a combatant swimmer (SEAL), entitled to wear the SEAL insignia. Willink served eight years on active duty, as an enlisted Navy SEAL with SEAL Team One and SEAL Team Two. Willink was part of the SEAL team that seized the Russian Tanker Volga-Neft-147 in the Gulf of Oman, which was carrying Iraqi oil in violation of a United Nations economic embargo.[9] Willink earned his commission via Officer Candidate School and served as a platoon commander. Willink completed multiple deployments to Asia, the Middle East and Europe. During Operation Iraqi Freedom he deployed to the Iraqi city of Ramadi in 2006 with SEAL Team Three as commander of Task Unit Bruiser, which included Leif Babin, Seth ""Stoner"" Stone, Marc Alan Lee, Michael Monsoor, Jonny Kim, Kevin Lacz, Ryan ""Biggles"" Job, JP Dinnell, Tony Eafrati, Jason Hogan and Chris Kyle. Willink also served as a Navy SEAL instructor during his career. He retired in October 2010 after 20 years of service.[10]

After retiring from the Navy, Willink co-founded the leadership consulting firm Echelon Front along with Leif Babin, who served with him in the SEAL Teams.[11] He and Babin also co-authored the leadership manual Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy Seals Lead and Win.[12] After appearing on the podcasts of Tim Ferriss, Joe Rogan, and Sam Harris to publicize his book, Willink started his own weekly podcast, The Jocko Podcast.[13]

Cognitive Reframing (And One Life Hack To Reduce Suffering!)  What is cognitive reframing and how can it help?  How much of your pain is caused by how you think?  This video shares a powerful ‚Äúlife hack.‚Äù This video will help you understand cognitive reframing and how it is used in CBT, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.  We will identify what cognitive distortions are and how they can be changed with cognitive restructuring.  This video will also explain a powerful Buddhist concept, the second arrow of suffering.  The second arrow Buddhism is a helpful concept combined with cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety or cognitive behavioral therapy for depression.

The cognitive reframing examples and cognitive restructuring exercises will help you understand yourself better, and provide a pathway to feeling better. What is the definition of cognitive reframing and the definition of cognitive restructuring?  Cognitive restructuring is the active use by a therapist and client of cognitive restructuring techniques, that can change the lens through which the client sees the world.  It is a subset of cognitive reframing - cognitive reframing happens either naturally or intentionally.  CBT for anxiety is effective and cognitive restructuring techniques can help you feel better!

Our beliefs form our world. If we have the wrong beliefs, that we develop through either nature or nurture, we could end up with a bad life. Reframing these beliefs is one of the key tenants of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and can help us reframe what happens to us so it's in our benefit. 

What happens to us isn't so important when compared with how we decipher what happens to us. This video will dive into ways that we can REFRAME our beliefs so they give us the best possible road map to success. Reframe negatives into positives and reframe limiting beliefs into ones that help us push passed our road blocks. This video will help you understand that further.

I also discuss the neurochemical basis of introversion and extroversion, of trust and how shared experiences that promote similar physiological states in two or more individuals, leads to more rapid bonding. I also discuss how food and oxytocin play key roles in social bonding. This episode covers quality peer-reviewed science and practical tools for anyone seeking to find, build or end relationships.

Transcript (partial with notes)

Social connections

If you talk to someone that has recently moved, started a new job, or retired, and ask them what they miss most about their past situation, one of the most common answers is that they miss the people that were in their life.  What that actually means is that they miss the social connections or relationships they had with those people.

Social well being, social connections or social interactions with other individuals is crucial to mental health, which in turn is crucial to overall health.  The lack of social connections has shown to increase stress hormones, weaken the immune system, and lessen cardiovascular functions.  People who are lonely tend to consume more alcohol, exercise less, have less quality sleep, and fatigue easily.  

Social relationships allow you to share your achievements, and have support when times are tough.  Imagine achieving a long term goal you had, what is the first thing you want to do, tell someone, share your accomplishment with friends and family of course.  

Or imagine if something terrible happened.  Not having someone to lean on and talk to, can make that event linger, and make you feel even more isolated.   

Giving support in relationships can be more beneficial than receiving support.  When someone shares something positive in their life with you, it is a compliment.  

They wanted you to be a part of their success, and they know that you have a sincere interest in their life.  And when someone shares a tragedy in their life, you know they really trust you, and they are looking to you to help them through this difficult time.

Some social relationships can be bad.  A person that is constantly negative and has a poor outlook can bring you down, causing you stress, and negatively affect your mood.  

Someone that always talks about themselves, and makes all of your interactions about them, is not really a social connection.  In that case you are just an audience member in their one person show on how wonderful their life is.

Poor marital or relationship quality can also weaken the immune system, and erode physical health.  Dealing with the stress from a poor relationship can lead to over consuming food or alcohol, smoking, or taking medications to deal with the stress, which in turn can damage systems in the body.

Connections through social media can be beneficial, by allowing you to stay in touch with friends and family at distant locations, however, social media connections are not a good alternative for face to face in person contact.  

And too much time spent on social media can lead to more isolation and a greater feeling of loneliness.  It is a good practice to use social media in moderation.

To be healthy we need people in our lives, it doesn‚Äôt need to be 5000 facebook friends, and we don‚Äôt have to have everyone like us.  Having strong social relationships with just a few people is fine.  

A few people that we can share life‚Äôs good and bad moments with, a few people that we can connect with on a regular basis, with no stress, and no judgments, a few people who accept us for who we are.

SUMMARY:
--------------------

Successful people are creative and consistent in how they express themselves. They are happier because they pursue things they are truly passionate about, seeking their goals in their own unique way without conforming or trying to be ""appropriate."" 

Ask yourself these four types questions:

Creativity in Conversation: Am I truly being myself when I'm in conversations? Do I share my true thoughts, feelings, frustrations, dreams? Do I feel like the best of me when communicating with others? If not, how can I open myself up?

Space Creativity: Is where I live a reflection of who I really am? Have I designed or decorated my workspace to be uniquely my own? Could someone get a feel of who I am based on my space?

Creativity in Contributions: How creative was the last presentation or contribution I created or shared? You can't blame your boss or timelines for stealing your creativity. You need to have the will to create unique things. If you're being rejected for who you truly are or for the contributions you find creative and valuable, then that's just an indication you're in the wrong place or community. Don't risk silencing yourself simply to end up a cog. Bring your divine spark, your uniqueness and spirit, to your work.

Creativity in Legacy: Have I started working toward what will be my unique contributions to the world? Pursue your goals and dreams in your own way - it is your voice, contributions and relationships that will ultimately tell the world who you were. Be creative in leaving your legacy - that's how you feel fulfilled and experience The Charged Life!

ABSTRACT


Meditation as Medicine: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction  An Approach to Stress Reduction, Chronic Pain and Illness

Presented by Bob Stahl.


The Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Program was developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn, PhD, from the University of Massachusetts Medical Center and featured in Bill Moyer's series ""Healing and the Mind."" This program is specifically designed for people living with stress, pain or illness, and supports individuals as well as the work of therapists and other caregivers.
 
MBSR consists of intensive training in mindfulness meditation, gentle mindful movement and group support. The program is designed for people who yearn for more balance in day-to-day life, and it promotes healthy living, renewal and stress management.
 
Mindfulness is the practice of cultivating non-judgmental awareness in day-to-day life. Mindfulness develops the potential to experience each moment, no matter how difficult or intense, with serenity and clarity. One can feel more alive and gain access to the powerful inner resources for healing. Participants learn lifelong tools to help maximize life, even in the midst of stress, pain and illness.


Bob Stahl, PhD., founded and directs mindfulness-based stress reduction programs in five medical centers in the San Francisco Bay area including El Camino Hospital in Mt. View and O'Cpnnor Hospital in San Jose.  A long-time mindfulness practitioner, Bob lived in a Buddhist monastery for 8.5 years and has completed MBSR teacher certification at University of Massachusetts Medical Center.

They provide a novel take on how to be successful during your new job assignment (and/or during university coursework), especially when you find yourself in a situation where you are required to deal with complex unsolved problems, issues and challenges. 

For more details of the FOCUSED Project, please check out our official website
https://www.focused-polyu.com/

The 14 topics are designed to provide you with a more holistic take and go beyond traditional and conventional pre-training. Taken together, they will enable you to learn BETTER, learn FASTER and learn MORE than you are used to.

Each of the main topics covered provides you with (1) a brief background to set the scene; (2) what the topic is about; (3) three examples illustrating how to use the topic; (4) why it is important; (5) a brief ‚Äúhomework‚Äù exercise for you to apply.

The topics range from: 
1. What is ‚ÄúStaying F.O.C.U.S.E.D.‚Äù framework? 
2. Develop a complicated understanding
3. Using metaphors to make the unfamiliar familiar
4. Re-framing and the importance problem-setting using positive ‚Äúre‚Äù words
5. Situation awareness (making sense of context)
6. Current taken-for-granted assumptions
7. Integrative thinking
8. Reflective practice
9. Persuasive skills
10. Critical incidents
11. Improvising skills
12. Relevate: make the irrelevant relevant
13. Evidence-based management
14. The value of ‚Äúgood‚Äù theory and research

Physical activity is intentional activity that involves moving our body and working our muscles. In other words, it doesn‚Äôt only mean aerobic exercise, playing sport or going to the gym. Any little bit of extra physical activity you can do in a day is beneficial to your physical and emotional wellbeing.

This video is part of a series designed to help health practitioners learn evidence-based skills which enhance mental wellbeing and resilience. If you are a health practitioner, why not try these techniques for yourself? Once you‚Äôve practiced these skills and experienced the benefit, we hope you will be willing and able to teach them to others. 

If you are not a health practitioner, please watch these videos anyway! We encourage everyone to look after their mental health and emotional wellbeing in ways that we know work.

Regular exercise can increase these three neurotransmitters
In very simple terms dopamine impacts your level of motivation. Low levels of dopamine can result in low levels of motivation
High levels increase motivation.
Motivation is key to learning new material
Serotonin impacts your mood, anger, and depression. Low levels can lead to depression and higher levels can improve your mood which impacts your ability to learn

Norepinephrine naw¬∑reh¬∑puh¬∑neh¬∑fruhn  impacts your ability to focus
Low levels led to dull focus, high levels sharpen your focus

20 or 30 minutes of aerobic exercise has been described as miracle gro for the brain.

So let‚Äôs apply this knowledge with a couple of suggestions to help you start brainstorming

Before your next study session get your heart rate elevated for 20 or 30 minutes then start studying

Take your flashcards on a brisk walk and memorize while walking

While studying take exercise breaks while you study. It could be as simple as dancing, or jumping jacks during the break.

Job design refers to organizing tasks, duties, responsibilities, and other elements into a productive unit of work. Job redesign involves changing existing jobs in different ways to improve them.

Managers play a significant role in job design because they are commonly the individuals who establish jobs and their design components. Managers must make sure that the expectations, requirements, responsibilities, and accountabilities of work are made clear to all those who work in particular jobs. During job design, managers should consider the nature and characteristics of both jobs and people.

Motivation, performance, and satisfaction can be influenced by the level of each job characteristic. In other words, as one or more factor increases, employees should become more engaged with their work duties and responsibilities. Autonomy and feedback are especially powerful because they can magnify the effects of the other job characteristics.",0,0:06:11,Education,"['human resource management', 'human resources', 'human resource', 'hr', 'hrm', 'job', 'work', 'job design', 'job redesign', 'how to design a job', 'job analysis', 'Autonomy', 'feedback', 'task significance', 'Task identity', 'Skill variety', 'Hackman and Oldham', 'job rotation', 'job enlargement', 'job enrichment', 'person‚Äìjob fit']",,youtube,,Job Redesign_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKlLOHQr9UI,Moderate_Profile,Yes,Pranjal,

Cognitive distortions are thoughts that aren't actually true but feel true. Your thoughts twist reality, and you start to feel like you‚Äôre bad, broken, or deficient. Or you begin to see the world as dangerous, threatening, or cruel. 
But here‚Äôs the thing with cognitive distortions: you don‚Äôt realize you‚Äôre doing it. You think the way you see things is reality. It feels true. When you think or talk through the lens of a cognitive distortion, you sound rational and accurate to yourself. So is there anything you can do about this? Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can help you change how you feel by changing how you think. 
The first step is to learn what cognitive distortions are and notice when you‚Äôre using them.

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction. 
And deeper than all of that, the Gospel of Jesus Christ orients my personal worldview and sense of security, peace, hope, and love https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe

The definition of compassion according to the Merriam Webster dictionary is the sympathetic consciousness of others' distress together with a desire to alleviate it. 

‚ÄúIf you want others to be happy, practice compassion.  If you want to be happy, practice compassion.‚Äù  ~Dalai Lama

Breathe deeply, connect with the feelings of your heart, and build compassion.

Just like me, everyone is seeking happiness. May we all find the happiness we are seeking.

Just like me, everyone is protecting themselves from suffering.  May we all be brave and strong enough to make space for our suffering.

Just like me, everyone has known sadness.  May we all experience love and joy to balance the sadness.

Just like me, everyone is doing the best they can. May we all offer compassion to ourselves and others.  May we all accept compassion from ourselves and others.

We hope you enjoy!

About Me:
I‚Äôm Emma McAdam. I‚Äôm a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, and I have worked in various settings of change and growth since 2004. My experience includes juvenile corrections, adventure therapy programs, wilderness therapy programs, an eating disorder treatment center, a residential treatment center, and I currently work in an outpatient therapy clinic.  

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction. 
And deeper than all of that, the Gospel of Jesus Christ orients my personal worldview and sense of security, peace, hope, and love https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe

So in this video, I go through all you need to know about assertive communication and aggressive communication. 

You will learn the difference between being assertive and aggressive. You will know the guidelines for assertive communication. And at the end of the video, I share examples so you can see different ways of communicating the same thing in an assertive way and aggressive way.

Sleep Hygiene,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdRM9chZHaY,SLEEP HYGIENE - ITS IMPORTANCE  & METHODS TO PRACTICE GOOD SLEEP HYGIENE,MEDSimplified,unknown,50853,1143,0,48,"Most of us, when we hear this word, think about our daily routine of bathing, changing into fresh clean clothes, cleaning our rooms, etc to be hygienic.
Over thousands of years, humanity has evolved to a point where hygiene is a must, rather than just an add-on.
It prevents diseases, improves the quality of life, and makes us more presentable to society.
But what If I told you, most of us fail to recognize and maintain a very distinct yet important type of hygiene. Sleep hygiene consists of environmental changes and overall habits that pave the way for higher-quality sleep and overall better health.
Good sleep hygiene is all about putting yourself in the best position to sleep well each and every night. Everyone, from children to older adults, benefit from better sleep, and sleep hygiene plays a key part in achieving that goal.

When my clients come in for treatment for some of their challenges like depression, anxiety, or relational problems, one of the most common associated problems that they have is difficulty sleeping. This shows up as having a hard time falling asleep, staying asleep, or just feeling tired all the time. Getting enough quality sleep can make your brain function much better. You‚Äôll be better at solving problems and feel more self-control. In this video we‚Äôre going to talk about how to train your brain to sleep well. This is called sleep hygiene

Sleep is essential for good mental health. Lack of sleep can actually cause mental illness.  Research is showing that one of the most effective ways to treat depression is by helping people improve the quality and quantity of their sleep. One study of people with depression found that after resolving their insomnia, 87 percent of them experienced major improvements in their depression, and their depression symptoms disappeared after eight weeks of good sleep. https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/health/treating-insomnia-to-heal-depression.html

So how do we improve our ability to get sleep? We can train our brains to sleep better. Sleep hygiene means going through a routine that trains your body to know when to sleep. Like a muscle that strengthens with practice, sleeping well is a skill we can develop. Here are some essential skills to develop better sleep.

About Me:
I‚Äôm Emma McAdam. I‚Äôm a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, and I have worked in various settings of change and growth since 2004. My experience includes juvenile corrections, adventure therapy programs, wilderness therapy programs, an eating disorder treatment center, a residential treatment center, and I currently work in an outpatient therapy clinic.  

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction. 
And deeper than all of that, the Gospel of Jesus Christ orients my personal worldview and sense of security, peace, hope, and love https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe

What happens when your body tells you to stop yet, you keep going? Portia shares how self-care brought her back to health and it can help you too. Portia is passionate about promoting a holistic and inclusive approach to self-care that takes into consideration how cultural and social factors as well as experiences of discrimination based on identity markers (e.g. race, class, gender identity, sexual orientation) may trigger one's need for self-care and shape one's willingness--or reluctance---to engage in self-care practices.
Preston has been an Assistant Professor of Public Health at Cal State Los Angeles for the past three years, and will transition to Cal State Fullerton, this Fall. Her research focuses on addressing health disparities and promoting health equity through inclusive approaches to self-care at the individual and organizational level. She earned her Doctorate of Public Health from UCLA, a Masters of Public Health in Health Behavior and Health Education from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and her Bachelors degree in Cultural and Social Anthropology from Stanford University.

Self care is what's needed for your well-being and should always leave you with more energy and feelings of revitalization. Often, the activities that are described as self-care leave you more depleted and with less energy. This talk will break the myth and discuss the 4 components of self care that will support your overall wellness; 
-nourishing foods, 
-stillness & movement,
-time in nature, and 
-self expression.

Thanks in no small part to the digitization of our social lives, depression is becoming a bigger and bigger issue in western societies. In the space of just one generation, we've closed ourselves off and now spend more time in front of screens â€” on average, 10 hours a day according to a Neilsen report â€” than we do with our loved ones. Author and journalist and author Johann Hari explains that this isn't at all how the human species is supposed to behave. He suggests more actual face time with people, more community, and above all: becoming the social creatures that we have been for millennia. Johann's new book is the fascinating

JOHANN HARI:

Johann Hari is the New York Times bestselling author of Chasing the Scream, which is being adapted into a feature film. He was twice named Newspaper Journalist of the Year by Amnesty International UK. He has written for many of the worldâ€™s leading newspapers and magazines, including the New York Times, Le Monde, the Guardian, the Los Angeles Times, the New Republic, the Nation, Slate, El Mundo, and the Sydney Morning Herald. He was a lead op-ed columnist for the Independent, one of Britainâ€™s leading newspapers, for nine years. He is a regular panelist on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher. His TED talk, â€œEverything You Think You Know About Addiction Is Wrong,â€ has more than 20 million views.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
TRANSCRIPT:
Johann Hari: Thereâ€™s a really heartbreaking study that asked Americans, â€œHow many close friends do you have that you can call on in a crisis?â€ 

And when they started doing it decades ago the most common answer was five. Today the most common answer is none. Itâ€™s not the average but itâ€™s the most common answer.

And I thought a lot about that in so many of the places Iâ€™ve been in the United States. I interviewed and got to know an incredible man called Professor John Cacioppo, a world expert on loneliness. Heâ€™s at the University of Chicago. 

And Professor Cacioppo explained to me, you know, if you think about the circumstances where human beings evolved, right, we evolvedâ€”the reason why youâ€™re able to watch this through your laptop or wherever youâ€™re watching it, the reason why we exist is because our ancestors on the savannahs of Africa were really good at one thing. They werenâ€™t bigger than the animals they took down but they were much better at cooperating than them. 

Every human instinct human beings have is to be part of a cooperative tribe, right. Bees need a hive. Humans need a tribe. And if you think about the circumstances where human beings evolved, if you were separated from the group you would become depressed and anxious for an incredibly good reason. You were in terrible danger. You were probably about to die. Those are the instincts we still have. 

Yet weâ€™ve told ourselves a story that we can live without tribes. We are the first human beings ever to try to live without communities, to imagine that like some cowboy on the horizonâ€”and even the cowboys didnâ€™t do it this wayâ€”we can live alone, we can be alone. Thatâ€™s not the species we are. 

And itâ€™s causing, and Professor Cacioppo has proven that this loneliness epidemic is one of the key causes of the epidemic of depression and anxiety that we have across our society.

And I was really interested to find out well, who has acted on that? Who has tried to find an antidepressant for the loneliness crisis? I met an incredible man, one of the heroes of my book Lost Connections called Sam Everington. Sam is a doctor in East London, one of the poorest parts of East London actually where I lived for many years. 

And Sam was really uncomfortable because he had loads of patients coming to him who were depressed and anxious. And he had been told in his training even though he knew the science was much more sophisticated than this to tell people, â€œWell you feel this way because youâ€™ve got a chemical imbalance in your brain,â€ and just give them drugs. 

Like me, Sam is not opposed to those drugs. Heâ€™s in favor of them but he just thought this is not enough. This isnâ€™t solving the reason why these people are depressed and anxious. 

He could see how lonely and cut-off they were. So he pioneered a different approach. And Iâ€™ll tell you about it through one of the patients of his that I got to know. 

A woman called Lisa Cunningham came to Sam, and Lisa has been shut away in her home for seven years with crippling anxiety and depression.

I explain, however, that most commonly used gratitude practices are ineffective (such as gratitude lists). The key elements of highly effective gratitude practices are described, including the essential need for story (narrative), receiving or perceiving gratitude rather than giving it, and the role that theory of mind plays in this context. I also discuss why we can't simply make up feelings of gratitude and how reluctance undermines the process. I also explain the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie the reductions in fear and increases in motivation and lowering of inflammatory chemicals that effective narrative-based gratitude can trigger. Throughout the episode, I use the science of gratitude to design a brief but highly effective protocol.

About Me:
Iâ€™m Emma McAdam. Iâ€™m a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, and I have worked in various settings of change and growth since 2004. My experience includes juvenile corrections, adventure therapy programs, wilderness therapy programs, an eating disorder treatment center, a residential treatment center, and I currently work in an outpatient therapy clinic.  

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction. 
And deeper than all of that, the Gospel of Jesus Christ orients my personal worldview and sense of security, peace, hope, and love https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe

** The FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES Quiz **
http://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/ 

** CREATING A GOALS MASTER PLAN PAGE (Vision Board) (ROI / Return on Investment) **

-- Create a list with categories. These categories can be anything that you have a burning desire to implement achieving GOALS in. Examples include, but are not limited to: Health & Wellness, Exercise, Diet, Spiritual, Business, Financial, Income, Investing, Relationships, Home, Beauty. One of the best ways to tune into what needs to go on this list, is think about what you VALUE. What we value in our lives, tends to be the MOST IMPORTANT things in our life. What do you value? WHY do you value it? You need to know WHY?
-- Some Categories may be put together. For example Health & Wellness could cover many topics: Exercise, Diet, Sleep, Stress, Routine preventive appointments, etc. This will vary form person to person, and how 'specific' you need to get with your Goals. If you are a beginner at GOAL SETTING, you will most likely need more categories, than let's say a seasoned GOAL SETTER.
-- Next to each category/sub-category, write your projected goal for 2018. Underneath the category, make a bulleted list of what requirements it will to take, or what you are going to have to GIVE UP to be able to FOLLOW-THROUGH and achieve those results. BE SPECIFIC!!!
 Example:Â 
Let's say you go to bed between 10:30 and 11 p.m., but get up for work at 5:30/6 a.m.. You're goal is to get more sleep. Below would be an example of how this would look on paper or in a document ...

** HEALTH/WELLNESS ** (Category)

-- SLEEP (Sub-Category): Get more sleep (projected goal)

1.) No Television, computer or phone use (social media) after 9 p.m. Sunday through Thursday
2.) Set phone reminder to go off (nightly) at 8:45 to start preparing for that shut down
3.) NO eating, exercise or any other stimulant-inducing activity after 6:30 p.m. Sunday through Thursday
4.) In bed by 9:15. Lights out at 9:30 Sunday through Thursday
5.) Sleep in one of two days, every weekend
You may start with these exercises in order to achieve your goal, during the month of January. At the first of February, you reassess, if all is working and these exercises were realistic for you and your lifestyle, you will continue. If not, you will tweak them slightly for February. You will do this throughout the year. This method WORKS!!! It's all in the FOLLOW-THROUGH of looking at your Vision Board or ROI, every single month. Everything is subject to change (again be realistic), things change, life changes, circumstances change. It's learning to find what works for you. Then making it a HABIT!

In an upcoming video, I will share what is on MY list (and what my WHY is), and I will help you to tweak your list. The goal here is to be realistic with your goal setting. Also to learn to create monthly benchmarks to achieve those goals. Think of this as a vision board. There is POWER in VISIBILITY! You can't BE, what YOU Can't SEE!Â

A traumatic loss doesn't have to be the end of your living. Becoming cognitively flexible can save your life and others too. Dr. Chantrise Sims Holliman is a writer, speaker, educator, heart attack survivor, bilateral amputee, wife, mother, sister, and friend.  Raised in Newton, Massachusetts Dr. Holliman is the only child of two former educators who instilled in her a love of learning and the tenacity to see things through no matter the challenge. Through her fight with Lupus and struggles with becoming an amputee, Dr. Holliman inspires us to keep moving despite the obstacles we face. She turns tragedy into triumph, impacts the world, and shows us excuses only benefit those who make them. Her motto is: Walk in Your Purpose Whether You Have Legs or Not.

Mindful Breathing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feeDQw9K5xY,Mindfulness In Real Life: Learn Mindful Breathing in 2 Minutes,Therapy in a Nutshell,unknown,33211,1162,0,30,"Mindfulness in Real Life
In this video Iâ€™m going to teach you about mindful breathing, and Iâ€™m going to film this in my kitchen because, let's be honest, no oneâ€™s watching Youtube from a Buddhist temple where everything is peaceful and quiet all the time. Mindfulness works because you can do it in stressful environments. 

Mindful breathing is an essential skill that, when learned, can be super helpful at managing anxiety, depression, stress, overthinking, and bodily tension. It can help you get centered and grounded in your body and can also connect you to your ability to be intentional instead of reactive. 
You can learn this skill in two minutes - so let's go.

Start by settling into a comfortable position, and close your eyes if youâ€™d like to. 
Now, just notice that you are breathing. Notice what it feels like to breathe.
Notice what you feel, expand your awareness. What can you see? Hear? Smell? 
Donâ€™t try to change how you breathe but rather to simply bring attention to what it feels like. 
Pay attention to the in breath and how that feels. Pay attention to the out breath and how that feels. 
During this activity, it's normal for your mind to wander off over and over. When you notice that has happened, just gently bring your attention back to the breath. There are going to be distractions. As you address them, remember that you can bring yourself back to awareness by noticing your breathing. 
Be curious - what does it feel like to breathe? 

That is the gift of the breath. It's an anchor for the present moment. It's always available to us to help us get centered and present.  
Mindfulness is all about letting your senses, what youâ€™re feeling in your body, bring you to the present moment, helping you be aware of this moment and where you are: you are here. 
Mindful breathing can be part of a meditation practice, or you can just bring awareness to your breath throughout the day, taking just a moment here and there to get connected.

WHAT IS STRESS:
Stress is something everyone feels at times, and there are all kinds of stressful situations that can be a part of daily life. Low-level stress can even be helpful or motivational.

There are plenty of things you can do to help cope with stressful events, and simple steps you can take to deal with feelings of stress or burnout.

Stress is the body's reaction to feeling threatened or under pressure. It's very common, can be motivating to help us achieve things in our daily life, and can help us meet the demands of home, work and family life.

But too much stress can affect our mood, our body and our relationships ‚Äì especially when it feels out of our control. It can make us feel anxious and irritable, and affect our self-esteem.

Experiencing a lot of stress over a long period of time can also lead to a feeling of physical, mental and emotional exhaustion, often called burnout.

Stress can cause many different symptoms. It might affect how you feel physically, mentally and also how you behave.

It's not always easy to recognise when stress is the reason you're feeling or acting differently.

Physical symptoms:
‚Ä¢ Headaches or dizziness
‚Ä¢ Muscle tension or pain
‚Ä¢ Stomach problems
‚Ä¢ Chest pain or a faster heartbeat
‚Ä¢ Sexual problems

Mental symptoms:
‚Ä¢ Difficulty concentrating
‚Ä¢ Struggling to make decisions
‚Ä¢ Feeling overwhelmed
‚Ä¢ Constantly worrying
‚Ä¢ Being forgetful

Changes in behaviour:
‚Ä¢ Being irritable and snappy
‚Ä¢ Sleeping too much or too little
‚Ä¢ Eating too much or too little
‚Ä¢ Avoiding certain places or people
‚Ä¢ Drinking or smoking more

NHS self assessment tool for stress: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/

POSSIBLE CAUSES OF STRESS:
Stress affects people differently, and the things that cause stress vary from person to person.

The level of stress you are comfortable with may be higher or lower than that of other people around you. Stressful feelings typically happen when we feel we do not have the resources to manage the challenges we face.

Pressure at work, school or home, illness, or difficult or sudden life events can all lead to stress.

Some possible causes of stress are:
‚Ä¢ Our individual genes, upbringing and experiences
‚Ä¢ Difficulties in our personal lives and relationships
‚Ä¢ Big or unexpected life changes, like moving house, having a baby or starting to care for someone
‚Ä¢ Money difficulties, like debt or struggling to afford daily essentials
‚Ä¢ Health issues, either for you or someone close to you
‚Ä¢ Pregnancy and children
‚Ä¢ Problems with housing, like the conditions, maintenance or tenancy
‚Ä¢ A difficult or troubled work environment

WHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL ADVICE:
‚Ä¢ You're struggling to cope with stress
‚Ä¢ Things you're trying yourself are not helping
‚Ä¢ You would prefer to get a referral from a GP

Referring yourself for therapy
If you need more support, you can get free psychological therapies like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the NHS. You can refer yourself directly to an NHS psychological therapies service (IAPT) without a referral from a GP - https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/

Please seek emergency medical help if,
‚Ä¢ You or someone you know needs immediate help
‚Ä¢ You have seriously harmed yourself ‚Äì for example, by taking a drug overdose
A mental health emergency should be taken as seriously as a medical emergency.

Work-Life Integration,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE4jrY-XxcU,Switch -- Work/life balance to work/life integration | Brent Barootes | TEDxBrentwoodCollegeSchool,TEDx Talks,unknown,48086,257,0,26,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences - Switch: Work Life Balance to Work Life Integration ‚Äì Brent proposes it‚Äôs the time to turn off that belief that you can create a work-life balance and look to the possible future to understand and transform into work life integration.

A Brentwood alumnus, Brent Barootes has had a series of careers that require fast pace, odd hours and constant multi tasking. In addition to his work he has been an avid volunteer and community benefactor since the University. His career took him into sponsorship marketing where he worked for such organizations as the Montreal Canadiens farm team in Fredericton, New Brunswick on the broadcast side and marketing, then to the Calgary Flames and Ottawa Senators radio broadcasts designing, selling and implementing corporate sponsorship programs. From the pro sport world Brent moved into both the non-profit industry at the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation overseeing fund development and corporate sponsorship. In 2001, Brent launched his own company, now a leading national sponsorship marketing agency in Canada

Brent works to ‚Äúbalance‚Äù his work and family while volunteering for over 20 hours a week with his daughter‚Äôs Cub pack, her hockey team, dedicates community service through Rotary all in Calgary and also sits on two non profit boards in BC. This is all in addition to over 150 travel nights for business a year and 25-35 public speaking engagements per year. He has concluded he cannot make his work and life ‚Äúbalance‚Äù, so he integrates the two and will tell you all about that in his TEDxBrentwood Talk.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",0,0:16:04,Nonprofits & Activism,"['Business', 'tedx talks', 'Canada', 'TEDxTalks', 'ted x', 'tedx', 'ted talk', 'tedx talk', 'English', 'ted talks', 'Lifestyle', 'Career/Life Development', 'ted']",,youtube,,Work-Life Integration_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE4jrY-XxcU,Personal Achievement,Yes,LKS,

As he points out, your boundaries don‚Äôt need to be grand, they just need to be established. Carlos Hidalgo is what you would call a ‚Äúserial entrepreneur.‚Äù During the span of his 25-year career Hidalgo has served in two non-profit organizations, led global marketing teams in two enterprise software companies and founded two consulting agencies.

In addition to his various roles, Hidalgo is the author of Driving Demand, one of the Top 5 Marketing Books of all time according to Book Authority. He is also a managing partner in two software start-ups, serves on the board of one other and has followed his wife‚Äôs lead in volunteering for Beauty For Ashes Uganda, an organization dedicated to the long-term sustainability and healing for single moms and widows in Uganda.

Hidalgo has found success throughout his career and led his first agency to three consecutive Inc. 5000 awards. However, this often came at the expense of his family and finding balance was a continual struggle.  In 2016, Hidalgo left the agency he started in Atlanta and committed to developing work-life boundaries.

Since his departure, he and his wife have started a second consultancy with a different focus.  He is also working on his second book about his journey and expects that The UnAmerican Dream will be out in March of 2019.
